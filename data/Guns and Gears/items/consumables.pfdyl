	<Usage>worn eyepiece</Usage>
	<Description>This heavy set of mechanical goggles contains a variety of different lenses for different situations, including lenses that filter light at different intensities and frequencies and even some that capture heat and other stimuli. Clockwork mechanisms can swap between the lenses rapidly as needed. However, many of these lenses can only capture a single stimulus once and then are forever etched with it, making them unsuitable for long-term use. When activated, the clockwork mechanism on the goggles rapidly switches between the different lenses, granting you the benefits of all of them for a brief period of time.&lt;br&gt;

When activated, you gain low-light vision for 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Name>Cryomister (Lesser)</Name>
	<Price>3 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Cold, Consumable, Gadget</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>When you Activate a cryomister, you can either place it in an adjacent square or toss it up to 20 feet away. Once you've done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist, settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending on the type, making the affected area difficult terrain for 1 minute; at the GM's discretion, however, this duration might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage, the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a weapon, the cryomister's rapidly cooling mist deals cold splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through the affected area can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC depending on the type to ignore the difficult terrain and move at their normal Speed. Throwing the cryomister onto the surface of a liquid creates a floating piece of ice for the same duration, capable of supporting one or more creatures of the listed size.&lt;br&gt;

The area is a 5-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 17, and the cold splash damage is 1. The floating ice can support one creature up to Medium size.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Consumable, Gadget</Traits>
	<Usage>worn over armor and clothes</Usage>
	<Description>While you're wearing an impact foam chassis wrapped around your body, it Activates automatically whenever you fall at least 10 feet, causing a layer of soft, flexible impact foam to expand beneath and around you to cushion the fall. The impact foam decreases the falling damage by up to the listed amount, taking damage equal to the amount of falling damage the foam reduced. If this is enough to destroy the foam, it disperses immediately. However, if the foam has any Hit Points remaining, it remains surrounding you for up to 1 minute. While you're surrounded in foam, you are immobilized and have standard cover against other creatures, and other creatures have standard cover against you. The foam has an Escape DC of 15; a creature can also remove it by spending three Interact actions. You or others can also attack the foam (the foam has an AC of 12), which disperses if reduced to 0 Hit Points.&lt;br&gt;

A lesser impact foam chassis prevents up to 20 falling damage and has 20 Hit Points.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Price>4 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>1</Bulk>
	<Traits>Consumable, Gadget</Traits>
	<Usage>attached to a shield</Usage>
	<Description>Ablative shield plating is an amalgam device that provides a layer of additional protection for a shield. Ablative shield plating is cobbled together from parts of other shields, wires, scraps, and bits of detritus, adding mass to a shield. The process of attaching ablative shield plating takes 10 minutes, and you can't attach ablative shield plating to a shield that has any other attached item, such as a shield boss or shield spikes. When the shield is damaged, this additional material crumples, breaks, and falls apart, absorbing some of the energy of the blow. Otherwise, the additional material slowly crumbles over time. Applying the plating grants the shield temporary Hit Points that last for the stated duration or until lost. Removing the plating early destroys it.&lt;br&gt;

The shield gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute or until lost.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Usage>held in 2 hands</Usage>
	<Description>When you Activate an explosive mine, you place it on the ground in a square within your reach, priming it to explode when a creature steps on that square. If you have time in advance to prepare, you can place the mine on the ground before activating it, and you or an ally can try to use Stealth to Conceal an Object before you Activate the mine. If you don't Conceal the mine, its position is obvious at a glance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once activated, the mine is primed to explode when enough pressure is placed on the square where it's located. Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves onto the square, though it could happen if a creature intentionally places pressure on the square from a distance to safely trigger the mine. Once triggered, the mine explodes, dealing the listed fire damage to any creatures in a 5-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save.&lt;br&gt;

	<Traits>Clockwork, Consumable, Gadget</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>An instant spy is a tiny clockwork device that is small enough to be easily hidden. It contains the same audio-recording mechanisms as a clockwork spy, as well as a short-lived gemstone that can store up to 1 hour of sound to play back later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once you have activated the instant spy, it surreptitiously begins recording all the sounds around it for an hour. In general, it can hear sounds that are clearly audible in the location where you activated it, but not sounds that would require a Perception check with a DC of 10 or greater to hear. The GM determines exactly what the instant spy can hear and record, as well as whether or not the recording is clear in a situation where the original sound is quiet, distorted, or intentionally obscured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When the recording is complete, once within the next 24 hours, you or another creature can use an Interact action to play back the stored audio in its entirety, after which the gem crumbles to dust. If no one plays the recorded sounds back within 1 day, the gem crumbles into dust anyway. This prevents the information from falling into the wrong hands later. It's typical to use the Conceal an Object action to hide an instant spy in a location once you've activated it, since if you don't hide it, it's relatively easy to discover in a thorough search, despite the fact that it's small and relatively unobtrusive.</Description>

	<Description>)Gadget skates are metal devices that come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you Activate gadget skates, clockwork gears reveal small wheels that propel you along the ground, moving you up to twice your Speed. During this movement, you must succeed at a DC 20 Acrobatics check to turn up to 90 degrees, and you can't turn more than once or more than 90 degrees. During the activation and after the activation is complete, you can't Stride, Step, or otherwise move on the ground until the end of your next turn. However, you can use this movement instead of a Stride to perform a High Jump or Long Jump just after the activation ends, in the direction of your last movement using the gadget skates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You can Sustain the Activation of your gadget skates for up to 1 minute. Starting on the turn after you Activate the gadget skates, the first time you Sustain the Activation each turn, you gain the effects of the activation again: you move up to twice your Speed in the same direction as your last movement with the gadget skates, and the restrictions continue to apply until you choose to cease Sustaining the Activation or you reach the maximum duration.

Once you've done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist, settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet of ice.

If an affected square takes fire damage, the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a weapon, the cryomister's rapidly cooling mist deals cold splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the area on activation.

Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves onto the square, though it could happen if a creature intentionally places pressure on the square from a distance to safely trigger the mine. Once triggered, the mine explodes, dealing the listed fire damage to any creatures in a 5-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save.&lt;br&gt;

The mine deals 12d6 fire damage, and the Reflex DC is 29.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>When you Activate a cryomister, you can either place it in an adjacent square or toss it up to 20 feet away. Once you've done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist, settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending on the type, making the affected area difficult terrain for 1 minute; at the GM's discretion, however, this duration might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage, the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a weapon, the cryomister's rapidly cooling mist deals cold splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through the affected area can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC depending on the type to ignore the difficult terrain and move at their normal Speed.

	<Description>This complex clockwork outerwear, worn over armor or other clothing, is composed of thin, interlocking scales of myriad colors attached to numerous clockwork gears that can rotate between all visible colors and shades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When activated, the clockwork gears work double-time to temporarily switch and adjust the scales to match the exact coloration of the area around you, allowing you to blend in as long as you stay still. For the duration, you can Hide without needing cover or concealment to do so. This doesn't allow you to Sneak without ending your movement in cover or concealment, however, as the clockwork flips over and adjusts the scales to match your background as you move, giving the impression of rippling waves of color and revealing your movement. Once the duration expires, the overworked clockwork and scales fall apart.&lt;br&gt;

	<Description>When you Activate an explosive mine, you place it on the ground in a square within your reach, priming it to explode when a creature steps on that square. If you have time in advance to prepare, you can place the mine on the ground before activating it, and you or an ally can try to use Stealth to Conceal an Object before you Activate the mine. If you don't Conceal the mine, its position is obvious at a glance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once activated, the mine is primed to explode when enough pressure is placed on the square where it's located. Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves onto the square, though it could happen if a creature intentionally places pressure on the square from a distance to safely trigger the mine. Once triggered, the mine explodes, dealing the listed fire damage to any creatures in a 5-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save.&lt;br&gt;

	<Description>Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. The beacon then sparks into being, casting bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light in the next 20 feet for 1 minute. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round. Creatures adjacent to a flare beacon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled until they are no longer adjacent to it.&lt;br&gt;

The beacon shines bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light in the next 60 feet. Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the beacon must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be dazzled until they are no longer within 10 feet of it.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Traits>Cold, Consumable, Gadget</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>When you Activate a cryomister, you can either place it in an adjacent square or toss it up to 20 feet away. Once you've done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist, settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending on the type, making the affected area difficult terrain for 1 minute; at the GM's discretion, however, this duration might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage, the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a weapon, the cryomister's rapidly cooling mist deals cold splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through the affected area can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC depending on the type to ignore the difficult terrain and move at their normal Speed. Throwing the cryomister onto the surface of a liquid creates a floating piece of ice for the same duration, capable of supporting one or more creatures of the listed size.&lt;br&gt;

The area is a 5-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 17, and the cold splash damage is 1. The floating ice can support one creature up to Medium size.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>This ammunition was developed in Dongun Hold to minimize casualties to friendly fire, and is always marked by a burnished copper head or tip so it can be easily identified. Before you can fire a &lt;i&gt;trustworthy round&lt;/i&gt;, you must call out a target. You don't need to specify a name; the target could be “The angry tiger attacking our group on the left.” The round will only hit the specified target and will turn to gossamer dust midair if it misses the intended target or comes into contact with anything else; this also prevents abilities that redirect attacks. The round doesn't have any capabilities beyond your own to determine whether someone is who you think they are, so you can't use it to determine a disguised creature's identity. If you specify a target of “Seltyiel” and shoot someone disguised as Seltyiel who you thought was Seltyiel, the attack will still hit, whereas if you were about to hit a disguised Seltyiel who you didn't recognize to be Seltyiel, the round would dissolve. </Description>

	<Traits>Consumable, Magical, Transmutation</Traits>
	<Description>A series of small stone discs pressed into a single round make up this ammunition. When you fire an activated &lt;i&gt;stepping stone shot&lt;/i&gt;, whether you hit or miss your target, the shot creates a series of supports in a line that creatures can walk on as if solid ground. The line can ascend or descend at a 45-degree angle. The discs support any amount of weight, but don't otherwise pose any sort of obstacle; creatures and attacks can move through them if they wish. They crumble to dust if anything attempts to move or otherwise manipulate them. A creature can use a two-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to Stride up to its speed on the stones while causing them to crumble behind it. This ammunition does not work in firearms with the scatter trait. The maximum length of the line depends on the type of ammunition. However, the line also can't extend beyond the maximum distance for a Strike from your firearm (usually six times the firearm's range increment).&lt;br&gt;

The stones reach up to 100 feet, and they last up to the end of your next turn if no one collapses them.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Traits>Consumable, Enchantment, Incapacitation, Magical, Mental, Sleep</Traits>
	<Description>The night sky seems contained in this glass projectile. When an activated &lt;i&gt;dreaming round&lt;/i&gt; damages a creature, it induces drowsiness. The creature must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature becomes slowed 1 and fatigued for 1 round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; The creature becomes fatigued and slowed 1, and must attempt another Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns. If it fails, its slowed condition increases by 1. A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. If the slowed condition is removed or reduced to 0, the effect and the fatigued condition end. If the target's actions are reduced to 0 by this effect, it immediately falls into a deep sleep and is unconscious, during which it no longer attempts a save at the end of its turn. It wakes up automatically after 1 hour or if it takes damage, but not due to non-painful stimuli (such as noise or being nudged). When it wakes up, its slowed condition decreases by 1, though it must once again save at the end of each of its turns and might risk falling asleep again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; As failure, except the target is initially slowed 2.</Description>

	<Name>Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Adamantine Shot)</Name>
	<Price>3,500 gp</Price>
	<Traits>Consumable, Evocation, Magical</Traits>
	<Description>These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential. Each version has a different special effect.&lt;br&gt;

The shot is a high-grade adamantine bullet. The awakened adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage, all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a golem or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters the target's defenses, causing them to become flat-footed for 1 minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version of &lt;i&gt;awakened metal shot&lt;/i&gt; is uncommon even for gunslingers or other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets from this book.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential. Each version has a different special effect.&lt;br&gt;

The shot is a high-grade cold iron bullet. The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt enchantments the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other creatures, the target is stupefied 1 for 1 minute instead.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

On a hit, it attempts to counteract any polymorph effect on the target. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a devil or a werecreature, you get a success instead. If you counteracted the Change Shape ability, the creature can't use that ability again for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical success. If you hit a devil or werecreature not under a polymorph effect, the target is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute instead.</Description>
