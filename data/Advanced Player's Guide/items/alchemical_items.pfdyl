	<Name>Forensic Dye</Name>
	<Price>3 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>Activating this vial of colorless liquid requires inserting a small amount of another chemical or material, such as blood or mud. The vial reacts rapidly, transforming into a murky, reddish-brown substance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once activated, the dye remains potent for up to 10 minutes, during which time you can spend 1 minute to brush it onto a single object of up to 1 Bulk or across the ground in a single 5-foot square. Where the dye comes in contact with an exact match for the activating chemical, it takes on a bright blue hue, while staying transparent in areas where there is no activating component present.</Description>

	<Name>Ghost Ink</Name>
	<Price>3 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>This pale-blue ink dries rapidly, becoming fully transparent 1 minute after application. The ink glows red when exposed to heat, such as that from a torch or other open flame. This glow lasts only as long as the ink is exposed to heat, after which the ink becomes invisible again. The crafter of the ghost ink can alter the formula slightly to instead make the ink sensitive to sunlight, starlight, magical light, or heatless light created by an alchemical effect such as a sunrod.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While the text isn't glowing, a creature closely examining a surface marked with ghost ink can detect the presence of the ink with a successful DC 25 Perception check. On a critical success, they can make out the ink well enough to use Society to Decipher Writing. One vial of ghost ink is sufficient to write a page worth of text.</Description>

The GM sets the Survival DC based on the area's ability to hold scent rather than on visual clues, as normal for using scent.&lt;br&gt;

The range is 15 feet, the item bonus is +1, and the duration is 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Price>6 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>This shimmering, violet unguent forms mild chemical bonds between objects with a matching composition. You apply the adhesive to two objects, or to an object and a creature. You can check if the two share an origin (such as if they were broken from the same whole, or if a poison sample or body part came from the same creature) by holding them together with the unguent between; if they match, the unguent becomes sticky.</Description>

	<Price>14 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>You sprinkle these salts onto a single object up to 10 cubic feet in volume and no more than 40 Bulk to preserve it for 1 week. The object doesn't decay, and effects that require the object to be fresh don't count the time passing during this duration as having elapsed. When sprinkled on a corpse, this extends the period in which a creature can be revived by magic, as well as the wait time required before a corpse can be targeted again with &lt;i&gt;talking corpse&lt;/i&gt;. The salts prevent ordinary pests from consuming the target (such as maggots for a corpse or moths for a piece of clothing). Any creature can use an Interact action to disperse the salts from an unattended object and end this effect.</Description>

	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>This peculiar amber glue bonds two surfaces together almost inseparably. A single flask covers an area up to 1 square foot and must be used all at once to form a single bond between two surfaces. If the activation is interrupted, the bond fails and the glue is wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once two surfaces are joined with sovereign glue, they can be separated only with a successful DC 50 Athletics check. The adhered objects tend to break before the glue does unless they're particularly durable, though a creature determined to separate the objects can break off the parts connected by the sovereign glue and later Repair the objects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sovereign glue can affect creatures only if they are willing, and its bond can be harmlessly broken by carefully exfoliating the outermost layer of skin or waiting a short while for the skin to shed.</Description>
