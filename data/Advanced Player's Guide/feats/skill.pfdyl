    <Ability name="Bon Mot" level="1">
        <Traits>Auditory, Concentrate, Emotion, General, Linguistic, Mental, Skill</Traits>
        <Requires>Trained In Diplomacy</Requires>
        <Description>You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target's Will DC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Success&lt;/b&gt; The target is distracted and takes a –3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; As critical success, but the penalty is –2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.</Description>
