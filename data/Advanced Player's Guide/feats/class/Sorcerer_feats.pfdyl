Spiritsense enables you to sense the spirits of creatures, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts within the listed range.

Your spells have the effects of a ghost touch property rune. They can target or affect a creature projecting its consciousness (such as via project image) or possessing another creature, even if its body is elsewhere, though you must know about the possession or projection and choose to do so.
