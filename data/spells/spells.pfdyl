You can decide the specific type of animal (such as lion or snow leopard for cat), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose: AC = 16 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. 5 temporary Hit Points. Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet. One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +9, and your damage bonus is +1. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack bonus is higher, you can use it instead. Athletics modifier of +9, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of animal you choose:Ape Speed 25 feet, climb Speed 20 feet; Melee fist, Damage 2d6 bludgeoning. Bear Speed 30 feet; Melee jaws, Damage 2d8 piercing; Melee claw (agile), Damage 1d8 slashing. Bull Speed 30 feet; Melee horn , Damage 2d8 piercing.

You imprint the image, direction, and distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you within the animal. Optionally, you can attach a small object or note up to light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination; if it makes it there, it waits nearby until the duration expires, allowing other nonhostile creatures to approach it and remove the attached object. The spell ends after 24 hours or when a creature removes the attached object, whichever happens first. If there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.</Description>

        <Description>You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes: Weal The results will be good. Woe The results will be bad. Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad. Nothing There won't be particularly good or bad results. The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a “nothing” result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result.</Description>

        <Description>You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.

        <Description>Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead of you. If all three images remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2 on 1d6). With only one image, the chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on 1d6). Once an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and the attack roll becomes a success against you.

You can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon).

        <Description>You craft a trap by binding a hostile spell into a symbol. While Casting this Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level to store in the glyph. The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. You can set a password, a trigger, or both for the glyph. Any creature that moves, opens, or touches the target container or enters the target area that doesn't speak the password or that matches the trigger activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within. Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it has an area, that area is centered on the creature that set off the glyph. Glyph of warding's duration ends when the glyph is triggered. The glyph counts as a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed. You can Dismiss glyph of warding. The maximum number of glyphs of warding you can have active at a time is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

        <Description>You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends after the hostile action is completed. While exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.</Description>

        <Description>You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground. For the duration of the spell, you can move the target up or down 10 feet with a single action, which has the concentrate trait. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.</Description>

        <Description>You can ask questions of and receive answers from plants, but the spell doesn't make them more friendly or intelligent than normal. Most normal plants have a distinctive view of the world around them, so they don't recognize details about creatures or know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity. Cunning plant monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.</Description>

        <Description>You grant the target corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to speak the answers to three questions posed to it. This spell calls on the physical body's latent memories rather than summoning back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact for the spell to function. The more damage the corpse has taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers are, and it must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects.Critical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts you for 24 hours, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for that time.Success The target can provide false information or refuse to answer your questions.Failure The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before you can ask all your questions.Critical Failure As failure, but the target's answers are more direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic. It takes a –2 status penalty to Deception checks to deceive or mislead you.

        <Description>You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise can hide the targets' identities or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but it's not precise enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn't change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target; for example, you could make one target appear to be a dwarf and another an elf. Casting veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate action. It allows the target to ignore any circumstance penalties they might take for being disguised as dissimilar creatures, and it gives the targets a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises, and add their level even if untrained. You can Dismiss any or all of these disguises.</Description>

For example, you could make the target see all elves as humans, be unable to detect the presence of their brother, see their beloved pocket watch on their person even when it isn't, or see a tower in the center of town. The target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below. They also receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time they Seek or directly interact with the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother accidentally, tried to check their pocket watch, or studied the tower. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance bonus in situations determined by the GM, such as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.Critical Success The creature is unaffected.Success The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, but it knows what the hallucination is.Failure The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves.Critical Failure The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, and it trusts its false senses, taking a –4 circumstance penalty to saves to disbelieve.

        <Description>You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be within the spell's area. These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion. Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.

The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency with these attacks, and if they have weapon specialization or greater weapon specialization, they add this damage as well. On a critical hit with one of these unarmed attacks, the creature struck takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. The targets can't use concentrate actions unless those actions also have the rage trait, with the exception of Seek. A creature can attempt to end the spell's effect on itself by using a single action, which has the rage trait, to attempt a Will save against your spell DC; on a success, it ends the spell's effect on itself.

Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together).

        <Description>A Medium guardian made of magical force appears and attacks foes you designate within range. The spiritual guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon. When you Cast the Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25. The guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian.

        <Description>You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of yourself. When you Sustain the Spell, you can mentally dictate a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round. Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions, though it can't actually affect anything in the environment. Both the duplicate and your invisibility persist for the spell's duration. Performing a hostile action doesn't end mislead's invisibility, just like a 4th-level invisibility spell. A creature that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn't necessarily know you're invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn't necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion. If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another creature, as a part of that action you can attempt a Deception check against observers' Perception DCs to convince them your duplicate used that action. This doesn't fool anyone who's aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your Deception check would automatically fail.

        <Description>You attempt to call forth the dead creature's soul, requiring the creature's body to be present and relatively intact. The creature must have died within the past 3 days. If Pharasma has decided that the creature's time has come (at the GM's discretion), or if the creature doesn't wish to return to life, this spell automatically fails, but the diamonds aren't consumed in the casting. If the spell is successful, the creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the Boneyard leaves the target temporarily debilitated, making it clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. The creature is also permanently changed by its time in the afterlife, such as a slight personality shift, a streak of white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark.

A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect.

        <Description>You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying works like clairvoyance, except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for teleport and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.

You move at half your normal Speeds, but can move in any direction (including up and down). You can see onto the Material Plane within a radius of 60 feet; it is gray, hazy, and concealed from you. You can't affect the Material Plane, and you can't be affected by the Material Plane except by force effects and abjurations originating there. When the spell ends, you return to the Material Plane.

The entrance connects to the plane where you Cast the Spell, appearing anywhere within the spell's range as a faint, shimmering, vertical rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate who can enter when you cast the spell. Once inside, you can shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and the creatures you designated can reopen the door at will, just like opening a physical door. Inside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion featuring a magnificent foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The mansion can have any floor plan you imagine as you Cast the Spell, provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet deep, and 30 feet tall. While the entrance to the mansion is closed, effects from outside the mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa, except for plane shift, which can be used to enter the mansion. You can use scrying magic and similar effects to observe the outside only if they're capable of crossing planes. A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the mansion. These are like the servant created by the unseen servant spell, though they're visible, with an appearance you determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.

You must have specific knowledge of the destination plane and use a magic tuning fork created from material from that plane as a focus for the spell. While the tuning forks for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks. The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20x25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. Plane shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.</Description>

Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells— such as dispel magic—can't affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn't suppressed within the field. Spells of a higher level than the antimagic field overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field. The field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an antimagic field.

It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.</Description>

You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by—and effects created by—creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the controlled condition on a target of your divine aura, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your divine aura. When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute. It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute. The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, the divine aura's radius grows 10 feet.

Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand. Shaking Ground The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. Fissures Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require DC 15 Athletics to Climb. Collapse Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.Critical Success The creature takes half the collapse damage.Success The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls prone.Failure The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls prone.Critical Failure The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.

When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was banished, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.Critical Success The target escapes and the spell ends.Success The target is on the right path to the exit.

        <Description>You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that come into the wall's light must attempt a Will save; they're dazzled for 1 round on a success, blinded for 1 round on a failure, and blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure. They are then temporarily immune to the blinding effect for 1 hour. A prismatic wall has seven different layers, each a different color. Red, orange, yellow, and green have the effect of a 5th-level chromatic wall (page 323) spell of that color, and the others have the effect of a 7th-level chromatic wall spell of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls. The wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of the wall's level or lower; each color must be counteracted by its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't be affected until the previous color is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends prismatic wall. You can Dismiss the spell.

Your cause can't force the targets to harm one another or themselves. The targets become completely dedicated to that cause, depending on their levels. They choose their own actions, but they favor direct action over inaction or indirect action. 13th or Lower The target is so dedicated to the cause that it pursues the cause to the death (unless you say otherwise). 14th The target is dedicated to the cause, but the spell ends for the target if it's reduced to half its maximum Hit Points or fewer. 15th As 14th, plus the target can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns to end the spell for itself. The spell ends for all creatures if you or one of your allies uses a hostile action against a target, or when the cause is completed. The GM might determine this spell has alignment traits befitting the cause.

        <Description>You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one foresight spell in effect at a time. Casting foresight again ends the previous foresight. While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls and isn't flat-footed against undetected creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction. Foresight Trigger The target of foresight defends against a hostile creature or other danger. Effect If the hostile creature or danger forces the target to roll dice (a saving throw, for example), the target rolls twice and uses the higher result, and this spell gains the fortune trait. But if the hostile creature or danger is rolling against the target (an attack roll or skill check, for example), that hostile creature or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this spell gains the misfortune trait.

At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is flat-footed for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success. The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal or plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion. The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.

You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally. Your mansion contains the same types and quantities of foodstuffs and servants as created by the magnificent mansion spell.

Name war or peace when you cast this spell. If you name “war,” mentally choose one creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target's turns, if the target did not use a hostile action against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target. If you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike). Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target's turn, but its penalty is separate from yours. When the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.

        <Description>Choose a single statement you want the targets to believe. The fact could be narrow, such as “a dragon is circling overhead and wants to kill me”; wide-reaching, such as “all humanoids are disguised abominations”; or conceptual, such as “if I don't live a kinder life, I'll be punished in the afterlife.” The targets' experiences color how they react to this “truth” and how their behavior changes. If the statement changes what they perceive, they treat the change as a sudden revelation. The effect of the spell depends on the targets' Will saves. If a target is already subject to fabricated truth, your spell tries to counteract it. If the counteract check fails, the outcome of the target's saving throw can't be worse than a success.Critical Success The target doesn't believe the statement, and it knows you tried to trick it.Success The target doesn't believe the statement or realize you tried to trick it.Failure The target believes the statement for a duration of 1 week.Critical Failure The target believes the statement with unlimited duration.

        <Range>5 feet</Range>
        <Description>You fully re-create an object from nothing, even if the object was destroyed. To do so, you must be able to picture the object in your mind. Additionally, the material component must be a remnant of the item, no matter how small or insignificant (even a speck of dust that remains from disintegrate is enough). The spell fails if your imagination relied on too much guesswork; if the object would be too large to fit in a 5-foot cube; if the object still exists and you were simply not aware of it; or if the object is an artifact, has a level over 20, or has similar vast magical power. The item reassembles in perfect condition. Even if your mental image was of a damaged or weathered object, the new one is in this perfected form. If the object was magical, this spell typically restores its constant magical properties, but not any temporary ones, such as charges or one-time uses. An item with charges or uses per day has all of its uses expended when remade, but it replenishes them normally thereafter.

The raised creatures have a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points you gave living creatures, but no normal Hit Points.

Revival can't resurrect creatures killed by disintegrate or a death effect. It has no effect on undead.</Description>
