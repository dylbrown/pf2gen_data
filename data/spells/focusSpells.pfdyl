        <Description>You make the target overconfident, leading it to ascribe failure to external factors. If the target fails at an attack roll or skill check, it takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls and skill checks until the end of its turn (or the end of its next turn, if it attempted the roll outside its turn). If the creature fails a second time while taking this penalty, the penalty increases to –2. The duration depends on the target's Will save. After attempting its save, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.Critical Success The target is unaffected.Success The duration is 1 round.Failure The duration is 10 minutes.Critical Failure The duration is 24 hours.</Description>

        <Description>When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them past the worst of their affliction or intensify their misery. This spell attempts to progress a disease affliction, a poison affliction, or persistent poison damage affecting the target. If the target is affected by more than one of these, you can choose from among those you are aware of; otherwise the GM chooses randomly. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save to negate take its course. The effect of this spell depends on whether you're attempting to end an affliction or persistent poison damage, and whether you are attempting to help or hinder the target's recovery. Affliction The target immediately attempts its next saving throw against the affliction. You can grant the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or a –2 status penalty to its saving throw against the affliction. Persistent Poison You can cause the target take the persistent poison damage immediately when you Cast this Spell (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn). Whether or not you do so, the target attempts an additional flat check against the persistent poison damage. You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20 instead of the normal DC.

        <Description>You perform music so perfect that the target may die of joy or sorrow. Once targeted, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level and current Hit Points. 16th or Lower The target dies instantly. 17th If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes dying 1. 18th or Higher The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.</Description>

        <Name>Hero's Defiance</Name>
        <Level>10</Level>
        <Traits>Champion, Healing, Necromancy, Positive</Traits>
        <Cast>Free (Verbal)</Cast>
        <Description>You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing. Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover 10d4+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become unconscious or dying. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use hero's defiance again until you Refocus or the next time you prepare. Hero's defiance cannot be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as disintegrate.</Description>
