	<Description>This tiny, carved walnut shell contains a sacred mountain within. You can only activate &lt;i&gt;mountain to the sky&lt;/i&gt; on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, the walnut transforms into an impossibly steep mountain, 5,000 feet tall and 100 feet wide at the base. Climbing the mountain requires 8 hours and a successful DC 35 Athletics check. After activating it, if you climb to the top of the mountain without any assistance from flight or magic, the mountain &lt;i&gt;plane shifts&lt;/i&gt; you to Heaven when you reach the summit. You can return the &lt;i&gt;mountain to the sky&lt;/i&gt; into the shape of a walnut shell as a 1-minute activity, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, so long as no living creatures are present on the mountain.</Description>
