        <Area>1 cubic foot</Area>
        <Description>Your magic quickly flows over an area to help you count and catalog. Name a particular type of object you are looking for within the area. You gain an instant estimate of the quantity of the chosen objects that are clearly visible within the target area. The number is rounded to the largest digit. For example, you could look at a pile of 180 copper coins, and you would learn that it held about 200 coins, but you couldn't determine there were exactly 180 coins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The type of object you name can be as specific or general as you like—“dented copper coins” is as viable as “coins”—but the distinguishing features must be obvious at a glance, and the spell is automatically fooled by objects disguised as other objects. For instance, the spell would register copper coins plated in gold as gold coins, not copper coins.</Description>

        <Description>You create a shimmering extradimensional space accessible from the target's mouth. The space can hold objects and equipment, up to a total of 10 Bulk. This extradimensional storage doesn't hamper the target's ability to eat, drink, speak (if applicable), or otherwise act, as it only opens and closes when the target chooses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The target can Interact to swallow an object of up to 1 Bulk, which doesn't harm the object or the target. If the extradimensional space is full, the target can't add any more objects until first removing one or more stored objects. Organic matter and living creatures can't be stored in this space. The extradimensional storage is obvious to any creature who looks into the target's mouth, as the entryway shimmers slightly, though this doesn't clearly reveal the contents inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The target can Interact to spit out a single object of its choice, causing the object to fall to the ground in the target's space. The target can Interact three times in a row to spit out the entire contents of its extradimensional storage; the target doesn't have to take these actions all in the same turn, but if it takes any other actions in between, it has to start over. The items eject into the target's space, possibly spilling out into adjacent spaces if there is too much to fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When the spell ends or the target falls unconscious, the contents of the extradimensional storage are disgorged in a riotous spew, landing in the nearest unoccupied space, a bit wet but otherwise unharmed.</Description>

Any creature that ends its turn under the tree's branches takes 6d6 fire damage from the burning petals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Any enemy that can see the tree, even if the enemy is outside the spell's area, must attempt a Will save. This is an emotion, mental, and visual effect. Creatures fascinated with the tree must use at least one of their actions on each of their turns to move toward the tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected, but it must attempt a new save at the end of its turn if it can still see the tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; The creature is fascinated with the tree until the end of its next turn. If it can still see the tree then, it must attempt a save again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; The creature is fascinated with the tree until the spell ends. The tree's fire damage doesn't end the fascination; other hostile actions end it, as normal. If the fascination ends, the creature must attempt a new save at the end of its turn if it can still see the tree.</Description>

You imbue the area with the raw energy of that element, creating a zone that emits and amplifies magic of that type. The temperature might suddenly rise or fall, a storm cloud might form, and so on. Spells with the chosen elemental trait cast against creatures in the zone get a +2 status bonus to one damage type the spell deals based on the chosen trait: bludgeoning or electricity for air, bludgeoning for earth, fire for fire, and bludgeoning or cold for water. The caster chooses one type to add the bonus to if the spell deals more than one eligible type. This bonus is halved if the spell didn't use a spell slot (such as a cantrip, focus spell, or innate spell).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The zone has no effect on the spell if the spell doesn't deal any damage of an eligible type.</Description>

        <Duration>1 minute</Duration>
        <Description>You weave the threads of fate to lead two foes into a climactic battle. The targets of this spell are the fated opponents: one of the targets of this spell must be you or a willing ally, and the other must be an enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you Cast the Spell, the ally you targeted (or you, if you targeted yourself) may teleport to any unoccupied space of their choice within 30 feet of its fated opponent. This is a teleportation effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You isolate the two targets for 1 round. During this time, fate refuses to allow either fated opponent to be affected by attacks or effects from a third party; a fated opponent could be affected by the other's &lt;i&gt;meteor swarm&lt;/i&gt; or its own &lt;i&gt;heal&lt;/i&gt; spell, but it would be entirely immune to a spell or Strike from a creature outside of the spells effects, as well including damage from a hazard or the environment. This doesn't apply to anything that was affecting the targets before you cast &lt;i&gt;fated confrontation&lt;/i&gt; (such as a spell with a duration or persistent damage the creature had before it was affected by &lt;i&gt;fated confrontation&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For the duration of the spell, either fated opponent can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it makes against its fated opponent (a fortune effect), or force the fated opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a misfortune effect).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This spell ends if either target becomes unable to act, or if they both agree to cease hostilities.</Description>

The GM should roll to determine when the damage occurs secretly and determine the form of the accident as well as the type of damage it deals; generally, the accident should be one that deals physical damage of some type (for instance, a tree branch might fall on the foe and deal bludgeoning damage, or a window might break and fling sharp slashing glass at them), though other damage types might be appropriate in more unusual environments.</Description>

For the duration, each target is unwilling to receive any effects that require a willing target (in case the effect was secretly an attack), refuse to ingest anything (in case the substances have been replaced with poisons and cursed duplicates), doesn't treat anyone as an ally (in case its friends were replaced by an impostor), and doesn't believe anything it's told (in case of lies, though this doesn't mean the creature automatically believes the opposite either).

It can speak only on its turn, and it must take the Perform action when it does. The result of the Performance check determines how well it sang, but it stills communicate the information regardless of the result, which has no further mechanical impact than the time spent to take the action. A single Perform check is sufficient for any amount of speaking on the creature's turn.

If a container's contents total more than 3 Bulk, the transport fails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If either container is opened before the full 10 minutes have elapsed, the contents appear as they did when the containers were closed, and the process starts anew as soon as both containers have been closed. After the contents of the containers successfully swap, they can't swap again until after both containers have been opened at least once. Both containers must be located on the same plane for the process to function; if this ceases to be the case or if something else disrupts the effect during an active transposition, the process halts as if one of the containers had been opened.</Description>

If you target secured objects or those in another creature's possession (such as sheathed weapons), you must attempt to Disarm the creature of the metal objects, making a spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Instead of drawing the objects to yourself, you can polarize a single metal object within range, designating it as a lodestone and causing the metal objects to fly to it instead. The lodestone must be at least three times the total Bulk of the targeted metal objects.

In either your initial square, or another square adjacent to your initial square, an exact illusory duplicate of you appears. You decide a simple course of action for the duplicate to follow, such as to walk to a specific point or wave its hands in the air, but more complex routines are beyond its abilities. A creature can distinguish between you and the duplicate only if it spends an action to Seek and succeeds at a Perception check against the spell's DC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If a creature takes a hostile action against the duplicate, the illusion shatters into mirrorlike shards, inflicting bad luck on the attacker's next few attacks as misfortune's toll for shattering the mirror. The attacker must attempt a Will save with the following effects; this is a curse and misfortune effect. When the duplicate shatters, the spell ends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; Within the next hour, the creature must roll its next two attack rolls twice and take the lower result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; Within the next hour, the creature must roll its next four attack rolls twice and take the lower result.</Description>

Additionally, you appear to mimic their skill, although such appearances are merely an illusion. If they are famous for physical art, the spell creates illusions of physical artwork matching their style, and onlookers who don't disbelieve are convinced these works are as impressive as the real thing. If they are famous for their ability to perform, you create an illusory performance that tricks onlookers into thinking you are as skillful as the performer you're pretending to be. The audience can disbelieve this spell if they interact with your art or actively listen to the performance, using either Perception or an appropriate Lore, whichever is higher. When the duration ends, any fake art disappears, and those who were duped by a performance realize it wasn't as good as they thought, though they still might not discover that you weren't really the artist you claimed to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This spell can't grant you any benefits from special abilities that take such skill they require a Performance check, such as the &lt;i&gt;lingering performance&lt;/i&gt; focus spell.

        <Description>You take a deep breath as you survey a social situation, showing courtesy to all around you as your intuition swiftly picks up clues about social contexts and unspoken assumptions of behavior. Your body language subconsciously changes to take advantage of this information and use it in your own interactions with those creatures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As part of Casting this Spell, you Recall Knowledge using Society to gain information about the immediate social situation. You also gain a +1 status bonus on your next Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on those creatures present when you cast this spell, as long as the check occurs during the duration of the spell. You can &lt;i&gt;read the air&lt;/i&gt; only once in a given social situation; casting it again has no effect.</Description>

Furthermore, the plane protects you from energy of the alignments that oppose the plane. You gain resistance 5 to damage of the alignments that oppose those of your chosen plane. For example, if you chose Heaven, your Strikes would gain the good and lawful traits, and you would gain resistance to chaotic and evil. If you choose the Boneyard, the resistance is to negative and positive damage instead.</Description>
        <Heightened every="2"> The resistance increases by 5.</Heightened>

This animal is your choice of an eagle, guard dog, or raven.

        <Description>You temporarily bind a hostile spell into a symbol. While Casting this Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level to store in the glyph. The stored spell must take 2 actions or fewer to Cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. Any creature that enters &lt;i&gt;temporary glyph's&lt;/i&gt; area activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within. You can set a password for the glyph. Speaking it when entering the spell's area prevents the glyph from triggering. You can also set a more specific trigger to limit which types of creatures set off the glyph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell can target one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it has an area, that area is centered on the creature that set off the glyph. &lt;i&gt;Temporary glyph's&lt;/i&gt; duration ends when the glyph is triggered. The glyph is a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You can Dismiss &lt;i&gt;temporary glyph&lt;/i&gt;.</Description>

        <Duration>3 rounds</Duration>
        <Description>You prepare to steal spells from your foes, ripping them from the foe's shadow to stow them in an ephemeral pocket in the Shadow Plane. You gain a temporary spell slot, which you can fill only by stealing a spell from an enemy spellcaster. During &lt;i&gt;umbral extraction's&lt;/i&gt; duration, you can use the Steal action to attempt to take one of the foe's prepared spells or unused spontaneous spell slots instead of an item. You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting &lt;i&gt;umbral extraction&lt;/i&gt;. If you succeed at your check to Steal a spell, you deal 1d4 mental damage to the target per level of the spell stolen due to the psychological toll of the spiritual emptiness created by wrenching the spell away, and you place the stolen spell in your temporary spell slot. It gains the shadow trait if cast from this temporary slot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Determine the stolen spell at random from the target's spells that are 1 level lower than &lt;i&gt;umbral extraction&lt;/i&gt;, or from spells of the same level if you got a critical success. If the target has no spell slots of that level, use the highest level below that in which the target does have a spell slot. (If the target has no eligible spells, you get nothing, but you can continue to attempt to Steal spells for the remaining duration.) If the target is a prepared caster, you randomly steal one of their prepared spells. If the target is a spontaneous caster, you instead steal an unexpended spell slot of the appropriate level and determine the spell at random from all the target's known spells at that level. You can't steal a target's innate spells, focus spells, or cantrips. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it, and your temporary spell slot becomes a spell slot of the same level as the spell you stole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've placed a spell in your temporary spell slot, you can't attempt to Steal more spells. If you succeed at your Thievery check, you must take the spell you stole. Even if you're a spontaneous caster, you can use the temporary spell slot only to cast the stolen spell and you can cast only the stolen spell from your temporary spell slot. When &lt;i&gt;umbral extraction&lt;/i&gt; ends, you lose the temporary spell slot and any spell still stored in it.

        <Cast>Two Actions (somatic, verbal)</Cast>
        <Duration>3 rounds</Duration>
        <Description>You reflect a spell into a shadowy version of itself, in the process depleting the power of the initial spell. During &lt;i&gt;umbral graft's&lt;/i&gt; duration, you can use the Steal action to attempt to abscond with spells affecting a foe instead of stealing an item. You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting &lt;i&gt;umbral graft&lt;/i&gt;. If you succeed at your check to Steal a spell, randomly determine a spell affecting the foe that has a target entry. That spell ceases  to affect the target, and you can either cause the spell to affect you or store it in your shadow. If your attempt to Steal was a critical success, you automatically steal the spell if its level is equal to or lower than &lt;i&gt;umbral graft&lt;/i&gt;. If it was a success, you automatically steal it if its level is lower than &lt;i&gt;umbral graft&lt;/i&gt;. If you succeeded, but the spell's level was too high to steal automatically, you must attempt a counteract check to see if you steal the spell. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it. If you store it, you can transfer it to a willing creature as a single action that has the manipulate trait. The spell lasts for its remaining duration, to a maximum of 1 minute, and any time you keep it stored subtracts from its duration normally. The spell gains the shadow trait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You can't steal constant innate spells that are always active on a creature, such as a choral angel's constant &lt;i&gt;tongues&lt;/i&gt;, or innate spells that have special restrictions that remove their ability to target other creatures, such as an imp's &lt;i&gt;invisibility&lt;/i&gt;. At the GM's discretion, you might not be able to steal innate spells with other unusual modifications to the base spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've stolen a spell, you can't attempt to Steal more spells, nor can you choose not to take a spell if you succeed at your Thievery check. When you cast &lt;i&gt;umbral graft&lt;/i&gt;, any spells you stole with a previous &lt;i&gt;umbral graft&lt;/i&gt; end even if their duration hasn't elapsed. If you're affected by both &lt;i&gt;umbral graft&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;umbral extraction&lt;/i&gt;, you make the choice whether to steal a spell slot, an active spell, or an item each time you Steal.</Description>

You gain a +2 status bonus to your saving throws and DCs to resist forced movement and attempts to knock you prone. You reduce the distance forced movement moves you by half or 10 feet, whichever is more. You can only jump half as high and far. Rather than the normal calculation for falling damage, you take bludgeoning damage equal to the distance you fall. Abilities that adjust how much falling damage you take still apply.&lt;b&gt;Low Gravity&lt;/b&gt; You can jump double the normal distance when you Long Jump or Leap, though still to a maximum of your Speed.

        <Description>You place an invisible scrying sensor on each target just above their eyes. Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not. Each target can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended. For example, that means if a creature is behind a wall but hasn't moved, it's still hidden rather than undetected by a recipient that witnessed its current position.</Description>

        <Duration>sustained up to 1 minute</Duration>
        <Save>Reflex</Save>
        <Description>Powerful winds coalesce into a devastating tornado. You can Cast this Spell only if you are outside or the ceiling is 80 feet or higher. All squares in the whirlwind are difficult terrain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All creatures in the area take 5d10 bludgeoning damage as powerful winds and debris buffet them, with a Reflex save. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in a straight line. Each creature the whirlwind moves through takes the damage, also with a Reflex save. A creature can be affected by a &lt;i&gt;whirlwind&lt;/i&gt; only once per round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature takes half damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; The creature takes full damage and rises 10 feet into the air. If it doesn't have a fly Speed, the creature gains one equal to its Speed until it either reaches the ground or ceases to be in the whirlwind's area, potentially falling when the spell ends or when it leaves the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; As failure, except the creature takes double damage and rises 20 feet into the air.</Description>

        <Traditions>arcane, occult</Traditions>
        <Cast>Single Action (verbal)</Cast>
        <Range>20 feet</Range>
        <Targets>1 creature</Targets>
        <Duration>1 round (see text)</Duration>
        <Description>The target is energized by its good fortune as it spreads to others—as long as they keep winning. It gains the quickened condition for 1 round. If the target or one of their allies within 20 feet gets a critical success on an attack roll against a significant foe, whoever got the critical success becomes quickened if they weren't already, and the duration of the &lt;i&gt;winning streak&lt;/i&gt; is extended by another round. Creatures quickened by the spell can use the extra action to Strike, Step, or Stride. If a full round passes without the target or one their allies critically succeeding on an attack roll against a significant foe, the &lt;i&gt;winning streak&lt;/i&gt; breaks and the spell ends.</Description>

        <Cast>Three Actions (material, somatic, verbal)</Cast>

        <Area>20-foot radius, 40-foot rall cylinder</Area>
        <Duration>sustained up to 1 minute</Duration>
        <Description>You negate gravity's effects in the area. Creatures float in place unless they can Push Off a surface. Pushing Off is a single action which has the move trait, allowing the creature to move half its Speed in a straight line through the area. After Pushing Off a surface, the creature continues to move the same distance at the start of each of its turns until it leaves the area or Pushes Off against something else. A creature pushing against an untethered object of its size or smaller causes both the creature and the object to move at the same speed, but in opposite directions. Creatures who can levitate or fly can use those abilities to move around in the area without having to push off anything. Creatures who can't levitate or fly are usually on the ground, giving them a surface from which to push off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You can Dismiss this spell. When &lt;i&gt;zero gravity&lt;/i&gt; ends, all creatures and objects in the area fall back down.</Description>
