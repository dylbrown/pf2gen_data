        <Duration>1 minute</Duration>
        <Description>Shadows pour forth from your eyes, creating a field of darkness that prevents light from emanating within the area. Light doesn't enter the area; any non-magical light sources, such as a torches or lanterns, don't emanate any light while inside the area, even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. The spell similarly suppresses magical light of the spell's level or lower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness; any creatures seen through the darkness are concealed to them. Creatures with greater darkvision can see through the darkness normally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Creatures who move into the field or start their turn within the field have some of the life and light sucked out of them, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 negative damage, with a basic Fortitude save. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you cast this spell, choose up to four allies in the area to spare from &lt;i&gt;darklight's&lt;/i&gt; effects. Until the spell ends, they're immune to damage from &lt;i&gt;darklight&lt;/i&gt; spells and can see through &lt;i&gt;darklight&lt;/i&gt; (but not other darkness) as though they had greater darkvision.</Description>

        <Description>Walking over to an item to pick it up is so much effort. Whether it's your spellbook, a reagent, or a glass of wine, it's simply more efficient to call it to your hand.

If your next action is to cast &lt;i&gt;boost eidolon&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;reinforce eidolon&lt;/i&gt;, attempt a skill check with the skill associated with the tradition of magic you gain from your eidolon (such as Nature for a primal eidolon). The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances.

If you can use Spellstrike with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon.

A creature that fails its save can't speak above a raspy whisper for 1 round. A creature that critically fails can't speak or use abilities that require it to breathe for 1 round.
