The scroll case can be used to cast &lt;i&gt;longstrider&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;pass without trace&lt;/i&gt;.</Description>

	<Description>This unobtrusive belt pouch is popular among Pathfinders who operate in places where the Society is not welcome. It is constantly under the effects of a 3rd-level &lt;i&gt;magic aura&lt;/i&gt; spell to appear non-magical. The pouch’s normal space holds as much as an ordinary belt pouch, but it also has a small extradimensional space that holds up to 1 Bulk of items. A creature actively inspecting the pouch in its ordinary state discovers the existence of the extradimensional space only on a critical success to Search the pouch (see the Concealing an Item action of the Stealth skill), though when the extradimensional space is active, it’s obvious to anyone examining the pouch that it is more than it seems.

&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] Interact; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You switch the pouch to allow access to its extradimensional space instead of its normal space, or vice versa.

	<Description>Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.

 When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.

 There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.


You don’t need to eat or drink while this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; is invested by you. This &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t function until it has been worn continuously for a week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by someone else, this interval starts over.

 The resonant power allows you to cast &lt;i&gt;air bubble&lt;/i&gt; as a primal innate spell once per day.

A &lt;i&gt;dull gray aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; has lost its special magical properties, sometimes as a result of overusing a &lt;i&gt;tourmaline sphere&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. It still orbits your head like any other &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; and can thus serve as a stylish, hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like &lt;i&gt;continual flame&lt;/i&gt;.

 &lt;i&gt;Dull gray aeon stones&lt;/i&gt; have no resonant power.

This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass.

 An indentation in the middle of the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold a single &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. Placing an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; slotted in a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; also grants its resonant power.

 If you have more than one &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; with an invested &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, just not in &lt;i&gt;wayfinders&lt;/i&gt;.

Activating an &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power.

	<Description>As you invest these embroidered strips of cloth, you must meditate and slowly wrap them around your hands. These handwraps have weapon runes etched into them to give your unarmed attacks the benefits of those runes, making your unarmed attacks work like magic weapons. For example, &lt;i&gt;+1 striking handwraps of mighty blows&lt;/i&gt; would give you a +1 item bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed attacks, use two of that die size instead).

 You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and from the handwraps just as you would for a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you’re using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn’t function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.

 The entries below list the most typical combinations of fundamental runes.

	<Traits>Invested, Magical, Transmutation</Traits>
	<Usage>worn gloves</Usage>
	<Description>As you invest these embroidered strips of cloth, you must meditate and slowly wrap them around your hands. These handwraps have weapon runes etched into them to give your unarmed attacks the benefits of those runes, making your unarmed attacks work like magic weapons. For example, &lt;i&gt;+1 striking handwraps of mighty blows&lt;/i&gt; would give you a +1 item bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed attacks, use two of that die size instead).

 You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and from the handwraps just as you would for a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you’re using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn’t function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.

 The entries below list the most typical combinations of fundamental runes.

	<Name>Doubling Rings</Name>
	<Price>50 gp</Price>
	<Traits>Evocation, Invested, Magical</Traits>
	<Usage>worn</Usage>
	<Description>This item consists of two magically linked rings: an intricate, gleaming golden ring with a square-cut ruby, and a thick, plain iron ring. When you wield a melee weapon in the hand wearing the golden ring, the weapon’s fundamental runes are replicated onto any melee weapon you wield in the hand wearing the iron ring. (The fundamental runes are &lt;i&gt;weapon potency&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;striking&lt;/i&gt;, which add an item bonus to attack rolls and extra weapon damage dice, respectively.) Any fundamental runes on the weapon in the hand wearing the iron ring are suppressed.

 The replication functions only if you wear both rings, and it ends as soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in one of your hands. Consequently, the benefit doesn’t apply to thrown attacks or if you’re holding a weapon but not wielding it (such as holding in one hand a weapon that requires two hands to wield).

The rings also replicate property runes from the weapon in the gold-ringed hand, so long as the weapon in the iron-ringed hand meets all the prerequisites for a given rune and is not a specific weapon. The weapon in the iron-ringed hand gains the benefits of those runes. All its own runes are suppressed. When you invest the rings, you can elect for the rings to transfer only fundamental runes, in which case they function as standard &lt;i&gt;doubling rings&lt;/i&gt;.</Description>

	<Description>This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous red beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated, it briefly appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached by fine threads.

 Numerous varieties of the &lt;i&gt;necklace of fireballs exist&lt;/i&gt;. Each has a different basic Reflex save DC and includes a combination of spheres dealing different amounts of damage, as listed for each type below. When all the beads are gone, the necklace becomes a non-magical hemp string.

&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] Interact; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You detach a sphere from the necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. After you activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a &lt;i&gt;fireball&lt;/i&gt; where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the &lt;i&gt;fireball&lt;/i&gt; anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM’s discretion you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.

The pack grants you a +3 bonus to Survival checks. It also enables you to see the magical traces of creatures’ passage, allowing you to Track a creature that has teleported.

 The pack contains an extradimensional space with the same properties as a &lt;i&gt;type II bag of holding&lt;/i&gt;. This space contains the contents of a climber’s kit. If any components of that kit are removed and not returned, they return to the pack at dawn each day.

If you are 20th level, on a critical success your progress is 50 gp, 100 gp, 200 gp, or 350 gp for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, respectively.
