            <CritEffect>Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its Potency Rune, if any). This amount isn’t doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.</CritEffect>

            <Name>Bow</Name>
            <CritEffect>If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can’t move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn’t become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.</CritEffect>

    <Traits>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Agile</Name>
            <Description>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Attached</Name>
            <Description>An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Backstabber</Name>
            <Description>When you hit a flat-footed creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a +3 weapon.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Backswing</Name>
            <Description>You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Deadly</Name>
            <Description>On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater Striking Rune and three dice if the weapon has a major Striking Rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater Striking Rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Disarm</Name>
            <Description>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</Description>

        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Finesse</Name>

        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Forceful</Name>
            <Description>This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Free-Hand</Name>
            <Description>This weapon doesn’t take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free?hand weapon on it.</Description>

            <Name>Grapple</Name>
            <Description>You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</Description>

            <Name>Reach</Name>
            <Description>This weapon is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Shove</Name>
            <Description>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Sweep</Name>
            <Description>This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies.

            <Description>These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn.

        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Two-Hand</Name>

        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Unarmed</Name>
            <Description>An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn’t a weapon, though it’s categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it’s part of your body, an unarmed attack can’t be Disarmed. It also doesn’t take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.</Description>
        </WeaponTrait>
        <WeaponTrait>
            <Name>Versatile</Name>
            <Description>A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type.
