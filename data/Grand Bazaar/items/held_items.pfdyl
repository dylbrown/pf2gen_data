	<Name>Magnifying Glass of Elucidation</Name>
	<Price>125 gp</Price>
	<Traits>Divination, Magical</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>These well-aged wooden magnifying glasses are engraved with a variety of runes. Each is imbued with a specific language. When you use a magnifying glass to examine writing of its imbued language, it translates the writing into a language you understand. For example, an elf who speaks only Elven using a &lt;i&gt;magnifying glass of elucidation&lt;/i&gt; imbued with Dwarven would see Dwarven writing as Elven when observed through the magnifying glass. The magnifying glass only provides direct translations and doesn't automatically allow you to understand codes or extremely esoteric passagesâ€”you still need to attempt a skill check to Decipher Writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Three Actions]] envision, Interact; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You scan up to two pages of writing with the &lt;i&gt;magnifying glass of elucidation&lt;/i&gt;, imbuing the magnifying glass with the information you scanned. You can use a separate 3-action activity to have the magnifying glass reproduce the imbued information onto blank paper exactly as it appeared when you Activated the magnifying glass. The reproduction is a direct copy of the pages but doesn't imbue the reproduction with any magical effects or other special effects. As such, you can copy the writing of a scroll, for example, but it will only be mundane writing and not have any magical effect. The magnifying glass can only hold one instance of information at a given time; Activating the magnifying glass a second time or reproducing the information clears out the magnifying glass's information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Craft Requirements&lt;/b&gt; You know the language imbued in the magnifying glass.</Description>

Anyone inspecting a document notices the disguise with a successful DC 20 Perception check, but determining the actual text requires a successful DC 20 Society check to Decipher Writing. This lasts until you use this activation again, which ends the effect for all previously disguised documents; until you use the second activation to end the effect for a single document; or until a document in the haversack remains outside the haversack for at least 1 hour, ending the effect for that document.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] command; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You revert one of the documents back to its original state.</Description>

On a failure, a creature becomes fascinated and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn to move toward you. A fascinated creature can attempt another Will save if you move more than 30 feet away from them, and as normal, acting hostile to a creature or its allies breaks fascination automatically. Creatures that critically failed their save don't receive further saves if you move more than 30 feet away, and acting hostile to such a creature's allies allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination.

	<Traits>Conjuration, Extradimensional, Magical</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of infiltrator thieves' tools and any replacement picks, an elite disguise kit and any replacement cosmetics, and an extreme climber's kit, all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the &lt;i&gt;encompassing lockpick&lt;/i&gt; a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.</Description>

Items stored on the boat or ship form that are too large to fit inside the box form are ejected from the vehicle and appear on the ground adjacent to the box.
