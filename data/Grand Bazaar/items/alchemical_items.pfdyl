	<Traits>Alchemical, Cold, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>The contraption called cold comfort is a watertight pouch filled with a handful of small, heavy, silvery pellets. When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is immobilized for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 20) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check to Balance.&lt;br&gt;

Ice created by the pellets lasts for 1 hour or until broken.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>When a brewer makes a batch of something they'd rather not drink, they often boil it down; add myrrh, mugwort extract, and violet salt; and sell it to chefs looking for cheap sandwich fillings.

The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check to Balance.&lt;br&gt;

	<Description>The contraption called cold comfort is a watertight pouch filled with a handful of small, heavy, silvery pellets. When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is immobilized for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 20) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check to Balance.&lt;br&gt;

The area increases to a 20-foot square, the save DC increases to 34, the cold damage increases to 4d6 and the Escape DC increases to 31. Ice created by the pellets lasts for 3 hours or until broken. The block of ice is strong enough to support one Huge creature, up to 2 Large creatures, or up to 8 Medium or Small creatures.</Description>

	<Description>Typically only creatures immune to abysium's effects would don abysium armor. You're sickened 2 while wearing standard-grade armor made from abysium, or sickened 3 while wearing high-grade armor made from abysium. You can't reduce your sickened condition while wearing abysium armor, or for 1 hour after removing it. Abysium armor is dangerous to nearby creatures, too. Creatures within 10 feet of abysium armor must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 30 for standard grade or DC 40 for high grade) or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). Afterwards, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute, but if they remain within the area for longer than 1 minute, they automatically critically fail the next save.&lt;h3&gt;Base Material&lt;/h3&gt;Abysium&lt;br&gt;</Description>
