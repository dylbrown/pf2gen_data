	<Price>4 gp</Price>
	<Traits>Adjustment</Traits>
	<Description>This armor is easily doffed. A set of armor with armor latches gains the noisy trait. You cannot add armor latches to armor that already possesses the noisy trait. You can remove a set of armor with armor latches with a three-action activity, which has the manipulate trait. This doesn't affect the time it takes to don the armor.</Description>
