        <Description>On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</Description>

Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard’s spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale.

It is common for anyone entering into a life change, such as moving to a new town or changing careers, to look to Alseta for guidance.

        <Description>More than anything, Arazni is a survivor. Once, long ago, she was a force for good, a warrior-mage who sought to improve the quality of life for residents of her homeland. Long after her mortal death, she returned as a herald of the god Aroden and fought alongside mortals during one of their darkest hours. But humanity and her patron alike abandoned her—first to the Whispering Tyrant, then to the necromancer Geb—and the torments she endured because of it changed her deeply. Still she survived, her broken body reanimated against her will as a powerful undead monstrosity. For over a millennium she was held captive as the lich queen of the undead nation of Geb, and her view of mortals, and humanity in particular, soured.</Description>

Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh’s usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn’t an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.</Description>

        <Description>Chaldira Zuzaristan, the Calamitous Turn, is a plucky, impulsive goddess venerated primarily by halflings. She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others’ expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira’s followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons.</Description>

It is said that the Gossamer King was once swaddled in a cocoon, but was released by the curious Desna into the world with a cleave of her starknife. Since then, the goddess has pursued him in a macabre dance, hoping to kill him as they flit between planes.</Description>

Ages ago, she was worshipped in the Razatlani Empire as a goddess of might and protection in war. After the catastrophe of Earthfall, however, her edge softened; those who struggled to put the world back together called upon her to protect their neighbors and came together under her guidance to build strong bonds of community and support.</Description>

        <Description>Goddess of gems, stealth, and gambling, Nivi Rhombodazzle is the ultimate high roller, said to have won her divinity from the dwarven god Torag in exchange for a gemstone. She was once a mortal gnome who loved the thrill of an exciting wager, up to and including the moment when the dice turned against her. Eventually, Nivi’s debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin—uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.</Description>

Those days are behind Nocticula, for she has risen to the role of the Redeemer Queen, a patron of marginalized artists and protector of those cast out from society. She is now feared among her former peers for her persuasive words that tempt them away from their place in the Abyss and toward redemption. Her faith is strongest in the eastern reaches of New Thassilon, where her most powerful exile, Queen Sorshen, seeks to build a nation that welcomes those whom others have cast out.</Description>

        <Description>No ancient record reveals the truth of Sivanah’s origins; in fact, only recent documents record her existence at all. The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry—human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga— but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess’s true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess’s true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith’s growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.</Description>

        <Description>Baalzebul was one of the first angels of Heaven, a glorious lieutenant who followed Asmodeus in his exodus to Hell. In this new realm, he led the infernal armies and trained several other archdevils as generals. When Asmodeus divided the nine realms of Hell between himself and the eight archdevils, Baalzebul protested, thinking he had earned a place at his god’s side. Asmodeus responded by stripping away the archdevil’s radiant form, reducing him to a figure composed of swarming flies. Now known as the Lord of Flies, he rules over Cocytus, the frozen seventh layer of Hell, and attracts followers possessed of deep ambition and a powerful drive to triumph.</Description>

As Hell’s doorwarden, Barbatos oversees the spaces between worlds, and his followers are those who tread such interstitial paths and hold no qualms about the ethics of their journeys.</Description>

        <Description>The lord of Hell’s fourth layer, Phlegethon, is Belial. The Pale Kiss was created by Asmodeus as an object of adoration, with perfect form and beauty in the eyes of every creature. As a result, Belial has a virtually unlimited malleability of form, shifting between shapes almost constantly. His appearance is often as dualistic as his personality: half his body beautiful and half grotesque, much as he revels equally in pleasure and pain. As he is a creature of carnal desires, so are his followers: those who crave forbidden pleasures of the flesh but hide behind masks of respectability.</Description>

His realm of Stygia, Hell’s fifth layer, hews most closely to the nature of Hell before Asmodeus reshaped the plane, and it contains the sunken ruins of countless cities and libraries predating the war against Heaven. The archdevil hoards knowledge and secrets—especially that which has been forbidden— while spreading falsehoods and heresies to mislead the ignorant, and his followers revel in the same.</Description>

        <Description>Mammon, the Grasping One, oversees the vast treasuries of Hell secured in the vaults of Erebus, Hell’s third layer. As his angelic form was slain, he has no form of his own, so instead he infuses the very wealth that he guards, taking forms composed of riches and extending his senses out through each nigh-uncountable coin—he knows well the exact sum held in Hell’s vaults and the greatest treasures among them. His worshippers are the greedy rich and poor alike, and he often arranges for such mortals to stumble across a “lucky copper” through which he whispers encouragements for the bearer to indulge in greater and greater vices, eventually claiming their soul as his own.</Description>

The lord of Caina, Hell’s eighth layer, he is a conniving schemer and a brilliant politician, quick to offer insults both blatant and cloaked behind silvered words. A master of rule, law, and words, he is the creator of the renowned agreements known as infernal contracts, crafted to damn mortal souls through their own ambitions. He views mortals as nothing more than a source of power for the infernal realm, but he nevertheless has followers who share his affinity for the power of law and loophole.</Description>

        <Description>The general of Hell’s armies, Moloch, embodies infernal discipline and incomparable destructive power. Across his ream of Malebolge, the sixth layer of Hell, the Ashen Bull trains countless legions of devils to wage unending war. He not only teaches obedience, but demands it, punishing even the slightest misstep or insurrection with immediate, fiery retribution. Despite his harsh nature, Moloch is the most widely worshipped of the archdevils among mortals, as he is the most likely to answer supplicants’ mundane pleas. In exchange, he asks only their souls to add to his endless armies—a price many are willing to pay.</Description>

        <Description>Abraxas, the Master of the Final Incantation, is the demon lord of forbidden lore, magic, and snakes. Abraxas has an encyclopedic knowledge of magical formulas and destructive secrets, favoring those that inflict suffering and destruction. His Final Incantation is a word of power that can unravel the mightiest of spells and unmake even artifacts. He takes the form of a viper-legged humanoid with a fanged, deformed bird’s head. Abraxas’s cults are most prevalent among the drow of Golarion, but small circles devoted to him can be found in most major cities on the surface as well.</Description>

Originally a qlippoth lord, he was exiled by his peers for accepting mortal worshippers. Transformed into one of the demons he despises, Cyth-V’sug seeks to devour all life to put an end to demons and, ultimately, himself. He most often appears as an enormous draconic figure of snarled vines, fungal growths, and flailing tentacles. Cyth-V’sug is most often worshipped by recluses who seek to bring decay and destruction to their environs, though denizens of the Darklands also pay homage to him.</Description>

He holds court in an infinite ocean covered in disconcerting islands and deep-sea trenches filled with incomprehensible sunken cities. He appears as a massive creature with the lower body of an eel, a head reminiscent of deep-sea predators, and four thrashing tentacles in place of arms. Dagon began as a qlippoth, and no mortal understands his transformation into a demon lord, though it earned him the enmity of his former kin. Dagon is primarily worshipped by boggards, sahuagin, skum, and marsh giants, though desperate or depraved coastal villages have been known to pledge themselves to the demon lord.</Description>

He was formerly a fully fledged deity of ancient Azlant, but fell to demigodhood after being defeated in combat. Nurgal represents the sun’s potential for devastation, and his followers venerate him out of cowed awe. The demon lord appears as a muscular, tanned man with the head and lower body of a golden lion and a dragon’s tail. He is almost always depicted as wielding a mace in the form of a miniature sun, held in a taloned hand. Nurgal’s worshippers are primarily found in the deserts of Garund, Ninshabur, and Qadira.</Description>

        <Description>Once the lord of darkness and of the chaos of creation, Count Ranalc was cast out long ago by the other Eldest and titled “the Traitor,” though the Eldest are not forthcoming about what heinous treachery Ranalc committed, and many among his worshippers claim that he was the one who was betrayed. In his new home in a remote corner of the Shadow Plane, Ranalc embraced his banishment and became the patron of exiles, shadows, betrayal, and the betrayed. Ranalc had long held a fascination with the world of Golarion, and he was alternately both friend and foil to the powerful archwizard Nex. On the day Nex besieged the city of Absalom with shadowy beings—beings certainly drawn from Ranalc’s domain—the Eldest vanished from reality. Although he continues to grant spells to his devout worshippers, Ranalc has otherwise wholly disappeared. Theories about his disappearance abound, although they are as obscure and as self-contradictory as the enigmatic Eldest ever was.</Description>

        <Description>Known as the Twins, Imbrex is the mysterious Eldest of twins, statues, and endings. Appearing as two immense stone statues hundreds of feet tall holding hands and looking outward, Imbrex neither moves nor speaks. The Eldest sometimes communicates with telepathic utterances that rend minds or deliver psychic enlightenment, but they more often express their will through startlingly realistic dreams that sometimes manifest into strange life. An entire city named Anophaeus sprawls at Imbrex’s four feet, populated by jaded urbanites, eager aspirants, and prowling dream-creatures made real. An unusually high proportion of those born in Anophaeu are twins, and twins are also common among Imbrex’s worshippers. Although Imbrex appears timeless in form, they are intrigued by dramatic endings, particularly apocalypses, and have foreknowledge of disasters to come.</Description>

        <Description>Magdh is the Eldest of foreknowledge, complexity, and triplets, and she is the greatest seer in the First World. Most often appearing as a woman with three faces set equidistantly around her head, Magdh looks across the skeins of fate into myriad alternate realities and possible futures. Among all the Eldest, she has the deepest knowledge of reality’s true design and the ripples a single action or inaction can create throughout all of existence. Her communications are veiled in conditional language and oddly juxtaposed statements to an almost maddening degree, and thus she never communicates the prophetic truths she sees—so plain to her six eyes—in a straightforward way. Because of their shared knowledge of branching timelines, Shyka and Magdh can communicate more easily with each other about such topics, though the other Eldest are cautious around Magdh, lest a careless comment or errant gesture cause her to predict apocalyptic dooms.</Description>

        <Description>Rumors say that to glance upon the hooded face of Ng is to either see truth or face oblivion itself, but the Eldest of changing seasons, secrets, and wanderers keeps his visage perpetually shrouded. He is a serious and stern figure draped in silvery robes that swish around his legs as he walks lonely and distant paths. No carefree wanderer, Ng is a patron of those who travel long distances with purpose, and he sometimes shields them from banditry, treacherous weather, and getting lost. Ng keeps many secrets, even from his followers, and none know what his evidently aimless travels might portend. Ng rules over the seasons as they turn one into another, but he rules far more numerous seasons than the four familiar to Golarion, such as the Season of Carnivorous Light and the Season of Solemn Deliquescence.</Description>

        <Description>As boastful as he is bestial, Ragadahn the Water Lord is the Eldest of oceans, linnorms, and sinuous spirals. He appears as a great serpentine dragon in the First World’s seas, but he is widely traveled and takes other forms as needed to pursue both martial conquests and amorous affairs. He is widely believed to be the progenitor of all linnorms, and he claims to be the progenitor of all dragons. True dragons stridently contest this assertion, although they wisely decline to do so when in Ragadahn’s majestic presence. Failure to deliver proper respect to the arrogant Ragadahn invites his legendary ire, and no supplicant can ever be too flattering for his tastes. Yet for all his tempestuous nature, he is wise, and he holds much otherwise lost and forgotten knowledge.</Description>

Each has sequentially held the title of Shyka, picking up the mantle and the knowledge that comes with it upon the passing (or disappearance) of a predecessor. Shyka visits so many overlapping temporal locations that other creatures encounter a random-seeming Shyka each time. This Eldest knows of the multiverse’s birth as well as its death, having experienced both. Although Shyka claims to merely watch over the continuum of time, it’s an open secret that the Eldest makes slight changes in line with their own goals—or requests that their worshippers do so, with abstruse promptings.</Description>

Lush plants that entice prey only to kill with barbs or toxins lie within her authority, as do lustful acts and whispered secrets occurring in wild terrain. Her seductive form shifts from that of a beautiful fey such as nymphs to incorporating natural lures like sweet-smelling flowers and graceful verdant tresses. Just as the Green Mother’s form constantly changes, her mood shifts from suggestive temptress to indifferent poisoner. No matter her form or attitude, the Green Mother is among the canniest of the Eldest, and she maintains several loyal agents who keep her well informed about goings-on in the First World and beyond. This information fuels her intrigues among the Eldest, and they all believe it wisest to keep on the Green Mother’s good side lest their secrets be seductively whispered into the ears of their enemies.</Description>

        <Description>Although the Lantern King most often appears as a floating ball of light surrounded by runes that form a delicate crown, the Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transformation has taken on a dizzying array of figures. He often adopts alternate shapes to play pranks, and even other Eldest are not immune to his mischievous scheming. Although he insists his pranks are intended only to incite levity and bring down imperious snobs, the chaos he creates in the name of good-natured fun is, to his targets, embarrassing at best and sometimes outright lethal. The Lantern King wanders the First World more than other Eldest, and he can be encountered in crowded markets and lonely byways alike. He is frequently accompanied by the Witchmarket, a traveling caravan of entertainers and merchants that serves as his court.</Description>

Although his precise origin is a hotly debated issue, the Lost Prince is known to hail from a place other than the First World. The melancholy lord doesn’t speak of his home, and in fact he doesn’t speak much at all, as he’s prone to bouts of depression powerful enough to leach color from his surroundings and press his coterie of followers into respectful silence. Appearing as a gaunt, pale human man dressed in black finery, the Lost Prince bears vivid red runes on his brow and on the backs of his hands. He is studiously neutral in the schemes of the other Eldest, which makes his opinions and his favor particularly valuable.</Description>

Now, he is imprisoned within the Garnet Brand, a red gem encased in an eternal shroud of steam. Though he cannot hear or grant power to his followers from his prison, some groups of salamanders on the Plane of Fire still honor the Lambent King for his dominion over protection and life-giving fire, as do a few small circles of mortals who hold the discovery and purification of evil above all other causes. Statues depicting his likeness can be found across his former realms, hidden in ancient sites dedicated to healing and holy light.</Description>

Some say he is an immense, undead crystalline dragon, an ancient genie wizard, or even a discarded splinter from some long-forgotten deity, shed before their primeval destruction. His power, motives, and origins are likewise the subjects of innumerable rumors. This speculation is all inconsequential to the Fossilized King; even the politics of his plane falls outside his notice.

Cruel and tyrannical, Hshurha enjoys toying with outsiders in her realm, and she is known to be especially vicious toward creatures with solid forms. She creates and destroys magnificent ice and dust sculptures according to her tumultuous whims, and her machinations often seem convoluted and nonsensical, even to her inner circle.

        <Description>Kelizandri, the elemental lord of water, oversees the deep sea, waves, and drowning. The Brackish Emperor claims to be the offspring of an ancient god and a brine dragon, and he usually takes the form of an immense aquatic dragon with metallic scales and crystalline talons. He spends much of his time slumbering in his magnificent Palace of Salt and Bones, entertaining himself with rampages of wanton destruction and conquest whenever he wakes.</Description>

        <Description>Lysianassa, Empress of the Torrent, is the elemental lord of currents, tides, and water. Before she was trapped in the Gasping Pearl, the benevolent lord of water patrolled her plane as a powerful sailfish made of coral and streaked with mother of pearl. When she realized her capture was imminent, Lysianassa preserved the last of her strength within the Breath of Lysianassa, a vial that allowed her nautilus servant Riam the Unyielding to control the Plane of Water’s tides. Since Riam’s death, the currents of the Plane of Water have begun to slow, and may eventually come to a halt. Few recall the Empress of the Torrent’s name, but cults dedicated to an enigmatic figure called the Queen of the Depths have begun to arise, heralding an event they refer to as the Awakening, and some planar scholars believe these cultists seek to free Lysianassa from her prison.</Description>

When he appears before mortals, Ranginori takes the form of an immense, lion-headed serpent spun from forbidding clouds, with hundreds of clawed feet and a mane that dances with lightning. Recently freed from his imprisonment within the Untouchable Opal by agents of the Pathfinder Society, the Zephyrous Prince has accumulated a small but loyal following in search of liberation, hope, and change for the multiverse. He is regaining his strength and preparing to find and liberate the other benevolent elemental lords, bringing balance back to the Elemental Planes.</Description>

Planar scholars who know of the benevolent lord of earth speak of Sairazul as a mother and creator who gave birth to numerous races of outsiders, including agrawghs and xiomorns. She is currently imprisoned within the Moaning Diamond, a pure gemstone encircled by eternally crying winds, unable to contact the outside world. Several of her consorts still live to this day, searching the planes for her prison in the hopes that her release will usher in an era of renewed creation across the Plane of Earth. Though the Crystalline Queen can’t grant power of any kind to her followers, a handful of her children on the Plane of Earth remain faithful to their creator, and she is remembered with great reverence by Material Plane cultists who exalt creation and reproduction.</Description>

        </Spells>
        <Description>Called Grandmother Crow, Andoletta represents consolation, respect, and security. Andoletta makes a clear distinction between guilt and innocence: there is no in-between. For those falsely accused or who show signs of redemption, she offers a path back to the light. That path is never an easy one, but it is one worth walking, and she stands beside those who make the trek. For the truly wicked and those who show no remorse, she has no mercy. For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes. Andoletta also places great value on respect for the dead and the protection of children. To offer solace to the bereaved is true kindness and compassion. Children are slates with tremendous potential for good—if they can be guided and kept safe from evil.</Description>

        <Description>Appearing in art more than any of the other empyreal lords, the Spirit of Abandon represents freedom, physical beauty, and sexuality. More than anything else, freedom is what matters to Arshea. For many this is most commonly seen as freedom for sexual expression, but Arshea represents the freedom to experience all that is good in the world, be it an ideology or a specific emotional or physical expression. So long as it doesn’t harm others, Arshea believes creatures should do, think, and feel as they will. They encourage their followers to try new things, to think in new ways, and to wear new forms.</Description>

        <Description>Ashava, the True Spark, embodies moonlight, dancing, and lonely spirits. Dancing is Ashava’s true love, and she encourages her followers to dance often. For some, she is little more than a patron of that art, but Ashava is also a guide, both in spirit and in the physical world. For the living, she leads the lonely out of their difficult times, her lights guiding lost wanderers back to safety. For the dead, her haunting moonlit dances lead lost and lonely spirits onward to their eternal judgment. She encourages her followers to steer those who are lost—whether in the wilderness or in their hearts—to where they need to go. Priests of Ashava are the dancing light that guides the way, but will-o’-wisps are anathema to Ashava, and her followers destroy these creatures wherever they are found.</Description>

        <Description>The Silence Between flutters among and between the stars, representing distance, silence, and space. Often called Desna’s Shadow, the Black Butterfly is sometimes believed to be an aspect of Desna that has broken off and taken on its own life; her interest in distance and space certainly reflects Desna’s love of travel. The Black Butterfly finds the silence of the sea of stars useful for introspection and learning about oneself. Those who follow her take opportunities when they can to sit in silent meditation, in zones of silence and darkness when possible. Travel across large distances offers plenty to think about and contemplate, and the Black Butterfly encourages such journeys. She hates all evil, but she truly despises the powerful beings of evil that populate the Dark Tapestry, and her followers are expected to fight these beings and their followers without mercy.</Description>

She maintains there is nothing wrong with disagreeing so long as the disagreement is respectful, and that it is crucial to be open to discussion, willing to consider new information, and receptive to forming new opinions. Opinions are valuable in that they help understand other views, but Eritrice reminds her followers that opinions are not facts and can be incorrect and even harmful. When lies are spoken or become the rule of the land, those that follow Eritrice work through networks of like-minded individuals to spread the truth using messages sent to all who will listen.</Description>

        <Description>Femininity, martial training, and rings are the purview of the Warrior’s Ring. In the eyes of Falayna, there is as much grace and beauty in the martial arts as exists in any culture’s definition of femininity. The strength of womanhood is a hallmark of femininity, and strength in arms reflects this, with the flourish and personality of a fighting style a vibrant means for self-expression. Followers of Falayna learn to fight so they can both express their body and defend themselves if necessary, and strive to feel beautiful doing so, both in form and in dress. Falayna also enjoys rings, and as such she is associated with events in which rings are given or exchanged, such as weddings.</Description>

In particular, Irez understands how runes can supplement and empower arcane magic. It’s through this understanding that Irez is able to make enigmatic predictions on events in the distant future, which more often than not come to pass. Many of her followers are calligraphers, gamblers, harrow readers and others who regularly handle cards and symbols, be they for an arcane purpose, prophetic practices, or their more mundane applications.</Description>

        <Description>Korada, the Open Hand of Harmony, is concerned with foresight, forgiveness, and peace. In particular, he believes that although the tireless fight against wickedness is admirable, the ultimate triumph over evil will come in the form of redemption rather than destruction. Korada’s dedication to peace is such that he and his followers refuse to cause harm to their attackers, instead using their martial skills only to defend themselves. Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight. Korada rarely acts on his visions, however, believing the struggle that comes with true change is always worthwhile, whether or not such a change is successful.</Description>

        <Description>Dancing through the northern sky, the Shimmering Maiden represents constellations, homesickness, and northern lights. Pulura understands that the constellations are the guide with which mortals navigate their world, lighting the way so that those who travel or explore can always find their way home. The stories of the constellations not only entertain with tales of goodness and light and strength, but they are also a tool for helping others learn and remember the stars. This ensures that the map in the sky is easy to read and never forgotten. To learn this map and to guide those who are lost or otherwise in need of direction are exceptional callings, but even more so is to teach a petitioner to navigate the skies themself on the journey.</Description>

He represents strength in battle, wrath upon the wicked, absolution or vengeance for the wronged, leadership when needed, and virtue and duty to the innocent. He expects his followers to destroy fiends when they find them and to work toward truly earning the trust and acceptance of those around them. Those who follow him lead by shining example and can be found on the front lines of battle or any conflict against evil they can find.</Description>

        <Description>Guardians, monuments, and magic are the purview of the Mystic Angel. Soralyon believes that monuments and ruins are important links to the past. Guarding them against those who would defile or destroy them is of tremendous importance, lest people lose memories of who they are, where they came from, and what they have accomplished. As such, those who stand guard over monuments and ruins are blessed. Likewise, those who study monuments to the past and present with respect, or seek to preserve them for the future, are also blessed. Guardianship of others, but especially of those who study and preserve these relics to the past, is also of great importance to Soralyon. As magic is a valuable tool in guarding, studying, and preserving these monuments and people, Soralyon encourages the study of magic, preferably for use in learning or protection.</Description>

        <Description>The Cardinal Martyr presides over devotion, sacrifice, and scars. Vildeis is driven entirely by her abhorrence for evil. Evil should not and must not be allowed to exist. It should be fought without pause and without rest until it is completely and utterly destroyed. Not only does the fight never end, but every sacrifice that needs to be made to end evil must be made, and is worth making. There are no material rewards to be had for destroying evil—its destruction is all the reward necessary, and that reward can be enjoyed only once there is no more evil. Scars are the marks the fight leaves behind, the memory of all the sacrifices made. Vildeis expects total commitment from her followers, who leave everything behind and dedicate their lives to destroying all that is vile.</Description>

The more intricate the problem, the more rewarding the investigation, and through determination and ethical investigation, even the deepest of enigmas can be solved. Calculated, logical thinking is more important to Zohls than gut instinct. She sees patterns everywhere, and she teaches that detecting these patterns brings the truth to light. While all investigations are worth pursuing so long as they don’t hurt innocents, investigations that reveal the truth of crimes or other horrors, and that lead to justice being served and victims finding peace, are the most important of all to Verity.</Description>

        <Description>Before his mortal death, Trelmarixian had already destroyed an entire world. Born a daemonic-blooded tiefling, his hatred of those around him was an all-consuming hunger, and he never knew peace. During an eclipse, he performed a ritual so powerful it mummified every living creature on his world, and his heart was finally full. Dying from starvation but elated by his success, Trelmarixian heard a voice call out to him. The voice mocked him, exclaiming all he’d accomplished was insignificant compared to what awaited him next. Trelmarixian’s last mortal memory was of staring into an eclipse.</Description>

        <Description>Appearing as an enormous migratory bird—usually a corvid, but sometimes a songbird—draped in robes and carrying a tombstone lock and a giant bone key, Barzahk the Passage is the psychopomp usher who maintains the Dead Roads, the secret back routes between the planes and the mortal world. Among mortals, they are worshipped as a patron of compasses, travelers, and vigils. Barzahk is tasked with transporting the souls of those who die far from home to ensure that they reach their proper destination. Unfortunately, Barzahk wanders far and wide, and so they rarely attend to this duty. Thus his followers, both psychopomps and mortals, take it upon themselves to care for lost souls, both literal and figurative. Like their patron, followers of Barzahk are often migratory, helping those they find along the way.</Description>

        <Description>Also known as the Waiting Void, the unseen Kerkamoth is the primordial inevitable of emptiness, entropy, and stillness. Though many people view decay and entropy as manifestations of chaos, followers of Kerkamoth understand that in an orderly universe, the end of one cycle makes way for the beginning of a new cycle. These worshippers track such transitions and work to properly dispose of those things that have outlived their usefulness, whether it’s cleaning a cluttered closet or demolishing an old building. Yet, Kerkamoth opposes those who destroy with abandon and no greater purpose, which often brings them in conflict with daemons, demons, and proteans. Though they favor areas of emptiness and silence to commune with their patron, worshippers of Kerkamoth recognize that these too cannot last forever, inevitably to be filled with new creations.</Description>

        <Description>All aeons come from, return to, are connected with, and are guided by the Monad. The Condition of All is not a deity in the traditional sense. It exists both within and outside the multiverse and has influence over the entirety of existence. Though generally content to allow the multiverse to run its course, the Monad directs its aeons to intervene when events deviate from their ineffable design. Mortal scholars often personify the Monad as the deity of creation, the infinite, and truth. Even so, few worship it, and the Monad pays very little attention to mortal petitioners. Instead, scholars study and plot aeons’ actions, striving to discern the Monad’s ultimate goal or to uncover universal truths they can exploit for their own purposes. Only a rare few mortals can master the asceticism necessary to connect with the Monad, gaining hidden knowledge and powers akin to those of other divine spellcasters.</Description>

Mother Vulture reflects the dualistic process of decay. She is a vicious killer whose feasts stain the ground, representing the death inherent in decay, but also a thoughtful mother, representing the new life that can take root in the fertile soil left in the wake of destruction. Mother Vulture’s mortal worshippers, who often dwell in deserts and swamps, revere her as the patron of consumption, renewal, and transformation. In this last aspect, she judges those souls who sought redemption in life, deciding whether their atonement was sufficient to avoid an undesired afterlife.</Description>

        <Description>Called the Crownless and the Maker of Kings, Narriseminek often appears as a protean with a scar around their pate, as if left by a burning crown. Their true form, though similar, is rarely seen: an iridescent and golden protean with a halo of burning eyes but empty eye sockets. The protean lord of ascendance, keketars, and revelations rarely interacts with non-proteans, but to their protean worshippers, they offer exalted transformations and revelations that can change a being’s entire outlook. Worshippers of Narriseminek, both mortal and protean, spend their time divining the future and using magic to transform their bodies—a practice they also extend to any other willing creatures who ask. Their revelations take the form of patterns emerging in otherwise random events; Narriseminek’s followers reject astrology and other forms of divination based on predictable cycles.</Description>

Saloc has even been known to resurrect condemned souls to give them a second chance to prove themselves. Mortals revere Saloc as the patron of agency, bronze, and education. These followers are people who seek to improve themselves or others, including both students and teachers. Some seek to earn their freedom from earthly prisons, while others wish to change their ways to avoid punishment in the hereafter.</Description>

Valmallos understands all the laws of magic, and sends his agents against those who have acquired magical ability that they have neither earned nor have the discipline to control. Many scholars of magic believe Valmallos is at least partly responsible for the complex material, somatic, and verbal components necessary to perform magic. His followers are spellcasters who seek perfection in the performance and effects of their magic. Though willing to teach magic to others, they cloak their techniques in layers of ritual to weed out those who lack the patience to handle magic properly.</Description>

Closer inspection reveals that their body is made from interlacing strands of poetic protean script. Ydajisk is also called the Mother of Tongues, though like all proteans, their gender changes as they will. Followers of Ydajisk are wanderers, reviving dead languages from ancient ruins, chronicling the dying tongues of cultures in decline, and discovering or inventing new words. All such knowledge acquired by agents of the Mother of Tongues passes into Ydajisk’s realm, the Library of Stolen Words, where it is transcribed into books or stored in magical containers, alongside scrolls and tomes considered long lost by mortal scholars.</Description>

        <Description>Azathoth is the Daemon Sultan and the Primal Chaos, a roiling mass of destructive and transformative power the size of a sun, dwelling in the darkness between the stars, deep in the center of the universe. There, masked from mortal sight by a veil of swirling colors, he is surrounded by the other Outer Gods that make up his court, dancing and cavorting about him endlessly, filling the void with the sound of ghastly flutes. Azathoth is utterly unaware of and uncaring toward those few who have come to revere and worship him. It is precisely this blind, uncaring nature that makes Azathoth the perfect embodiment of a blind, uncaring universe. Azathoth’s name, however, has great power over the Outer Gods when properly invoked. He has also sometimes been summoned by mortal priests—and though these summons attract only a tiny sliver of his attention and manifest as a form other than that of the Primal Chaos, they nevertheless lead to destruction on a massive scale.</Description>

        <Description>Nyarlathotep is a being of a thousand shapes, each of which has a name, such as the Haunter of the Dark or the Black Pharaoh. Because he has walked the world in mortal form, Nyarlathotep is unique among the Outer Gods for appearing comprehensible and understandable—but this is a facade. The Crawling Chaos, as he is also known, appears humanlike not because he identifies with mortal concerns or cares for his mortal followers, but because a mortal shape makes it easier for him to do his work: spreading the influence of the Outer Gods.</Description>

        <Description>Yog-Sothoth is, along with Azathoth, one of the greatest of the Outer Gods.

He has other manifestations, however, including the Lurker on the Threshold, a mass of black tentacles that endlessly writhe, reach, and grow, and a mysterious humanoid figure hidden behind a shimmering veil.</Description>

        <Description>When mortals were young, before Asmodeus conquered Hell, Ardad Lili was already manipulating amorous and lustful mortals to swear fealty to her, amassing power from their souls. She fled the realm of Nirvana during the Exodus, taking up residence in Avernus and continuing to gather an army of damned souls and female devils who share her ambitions. The Serpent Muse has never forgotten the censures and cruel insults spewed by the other natives of Nirvana, and she seeks to someday rule not a layer of Hell, but a realm of the heavens. Herself a passionate being, she draws similarly passionate followers.</Description>

        <Description>Perhaps the cruelest of Hell’s divinities, the Sadistic Angel shares certain characteristics with the velstracs who once resided in Hell—most notably, a drive to inflict physical pain upon living creatures. She does not inflict her torments out of anger or retribution; she practices her art with an unparalleled detachment and absence of emotion. Her followers are sadists, torturers who relish their grisly work, and those diabolists who summon velstracs rather than devils. While she bears the title of Queen of the Night and commands power commensurate with the others, Our Lady in Pain is content with her station and holds no ambitions beyond ensuring she can continue her tortures uninterrupted.</Description>

Eiseth operates outside Dispater’s rule, and she has forged powerful alliances with those in Hell and beyond, having long ago rejected limitations placed upon her by others.

        <Description>While the other Queens of the Night are all fallen celestials, Mahathallah was once among the most powerful of the monitors: a psychopomp usher in service of Pharasma. Granted a glimpse of the end of her own existence, Mahathallah fled to the pits of Hell, finding some form of solace in Asmodeus’s counsel. Now the Dowager of Illusions, Mahathallah deals in death, fate, and vanity, pulling back the veils of lies that obscure the profound facts of existence. She teaches her followers to seek the truths underlying each falsehood, fomenting arrogance and callousness in them. She also serves as a distant, deliberate advisor to the other Queens of the Night.</Description>

Impulsive and passionate, his heart moves between joy, sorrow, and anger in the time it takes him to finish his cup, though whatever his mood, he rarely feels it lightly. He may be so moved by a fisher’s prayer that he blesses her with a catch large enough to feed her village, while later unleashing torrential waves against that same village for a slight. This unpredictability leads the rest of the Heavenly Court to regard him as troublesome, and mortals to view him with wary respect.</Description>

        <Description>Gogunta, Song of the Swamp, is the demon lord of amphibians, boggards, and swamps. Gogunta is worshipped as a goddess by boggards, who believe her to be an ascended mobogo, though scholars suspect she was a former hezrou who gained the favor of Dagon. Lending credence to this latter theory, her realm, a stinking salt marsh, is located within Dagon’s oceanic realm. Gogunta appears as an enormous, multi-headed frog with dozens of eyes and even more tongues, though boggards typically depict her as a titanic boggard queen.</Description>

Aristocrats, city guards, merchants, and those working in legal practice or who have the well-being of their community on their mind are common worshippers of the god of cities, along with dwarves in general. Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order.</Description>

Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her—though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.</Description>

        <Description>Once a mortal human, Cayden Cailean is now one the few deities known as the Ascended. In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden’s attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.</Description>

He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened. He desires his followers to live their lives in peace, with no risk of being conscripted into armies, devoured by monsters, or destroyed by magic.</Description>

Good or evil, law or chaos, the reason for the fight is irrelevant. It is the thrill of battle that finds his favor, the crucible of struggle in which victory is there for the taking.</Description>

        <Description>Norgorber is the most mysterious of the Ascended, the group of mortals who assumed godhood after passing the Test of the Starstone. Unlike Iomedae’s and Cayden Cailean’s mortal existences, Norgorber’s life before his ascension is a mystery; the god himself has shrouded details of his mortal life in secrecy. This is no surprise to those familiar with Norgorber—he is the master of all secrets, a calculating manipulator who cleverly and ruthlessly wields the power of hidden knowledge to achieve his own ends. Only his most trusted worshippers know enough about his goals to assist in the god’s plans, and even those worshippers often have their memories modified after their parts in Norgorber’s schemes are complete.</Description>

        <Description>No record of history, and not even other gods, can recall a time before Pharasma. Her throne lies within a vast, gothic cathedral located on the infinite Spire at the center of the planes. From here, she looks both forward and backward in time, observing the births, lives, and deaths of every soul, as she serves as the final arbiter of a soul’s destination after death. Psychopomp servants of Pharasma guide and safeguard newly dead souls along the River of Souls to her realm, where she judges each soul and ensures it is sent to the proper plane for its afterlife, according to its alignment and mortal deeds. Although she can see all possible fates and knows the fate of each individual, free will and choice can alter a soul’s final destination, and she places great weight on the individual’s actions and personal choices. Therefore, Pharasma withholds her final judgment until a soul stands before her. Her prophecies are cryptic, and their full meanings are rarely revealed until the foretold events occur.</Description>

        <Description>Rovagug has no single holy scripture. He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god. Each of their little efforts of destruction adds up and will one day free him, setting him loose to bring about the end of all things.</Description>

        <Description>Sarenrae is one of the most popular deities on Golarion by virtue of her association with the life-giving sun and her perpetual offer to help anyone be their best, even when they have made mistakes. Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun’s power for everyone’s safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage. They oppose evil everywhere with words first, and when necessary, with scimitar and flame.</Description>

        <Description>Shelyn watches over existence with a kind and loving eye, encouraging mortals to make the best of their lives by spreading love, art, and beauty as best they can. Even the crudest artistic awakenings are worthy of praise in the goddess’s eyes, as they represent an individual’s expression of life’s trials and triumphs. She believes every creature is worthy of love and capable of creating art in their own way. Shelyn’s religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple. However, she does make the distinction between courtship and pure carnal desire, and she prefers that trysts blossom into more meaningful relationships along the way.</Description>

        <Description>The head of the dwarven pantheon is the most visible of the dwarven deities, to the extent that Torag is the only dwarven deity most non-dwarves know of. While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag’s areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deep-rooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves’ impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one’s work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag’s oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was long-established even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.</Description>
