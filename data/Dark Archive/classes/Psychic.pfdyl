    <Description>The mind can perceive truths hidden to fine-tuned instruments, house more secrets than any tome, and move objects and hearts more deftly than any lever. By delving into both the conscious and subconscious aspects of your inner self, you have awoken to the might of psychic magic, allowing you to cast spells not through incantations or gestures but by the power of your will alone. While the thin line between your mind and reality means that a single errant thought could have unintended consequences for yourself and your companions, you know that anything is possible, if you can imagine it.</Description>

            <Ability>
                <Description>You access the vast well of power that resides within your own mind, calling forth psychic magic with nothing but thought and will. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your subconscious mind.

            <Ability>
                <Description>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and three occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-level spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips (see below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells of higher levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

                <Description>You call on the depths of your mind and let psychic power flood through. Your Psyche remains Unleashed for 2 rounds or until your fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily quell your unleashed psyche. While your Psyche is Unleashed, the following effects occur: You're constantly surrounded by the visual manifestation of your psychic magic. When you cast a damaging spell, you gain a status bonus to its damage equal to double the spell's level. This applies only to spells that don't have a duration and that you cast using psychic spellcasting. You can use actions that have the psyche trait. After your unleashed psyche subsides, your mind must recover from the strain of channeling its full power. You can't use Unleash Psyche again for 2 rounds, and you're stupefied 1 for 2 rounds.</Description>

                <Description>The mind's truths come not in learned words or mathematical formulas but in deeper feelings and sensations. Emotions unlock the door to your powerâ€”you might consider your heart the source of your strength, or you might find that the infinite complexity felt in a moment expresses your power more efficiently than any string of mystic words ever could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thought components are emotions. You might summon the sense of freedom to buoy you through the air or let fear grip your heart even as you plant it in another's mind. Emotion components tend to impart abstract or vivid effects to your visual and auditory spell manifestations as well as more intangible flashes of emotion, such as swirls of joyous color or a sense of growing melancholy.</Description>

                            Your unleashed psyche gives you closer connections to the emotions of your allies, letting you project reassurance and strength that replenishes their mind and body.

                <Description>Many psychics are self-taught, frantically improvising how to best control their abilities before their power overwhelms them. Not you. Tutored by a mentor or classically trained at a facility for psychic development, you've learned techniques and teachings for best harnessing the mind, cataloging each expression of psychic power with a specific teaching, anecdote, or phrase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thought components are mantras you associate with a given spell, which you mentally repeat as you cast. You might silently utter a teaching of resilience as you spin force into a barrier or hear the first three notes of a traveling song as you slip through space. Mantra components often produce runes or symbols from your learnings that are unique to each spell you cast, causing your spell manifestations to resemble those of conventional spellcasters to a much greater degree than those of other psychics.</Description>

                            The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to Aid all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an Occultism check for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

                <Description>Determine intended outcome. Align thoughts. Identify and resolve distractions. Manifest. Intentional focus is the key to unleashing your abilities, whether that's because your power naturally tends to precise, discrete effects, or because you've adopted strict discipline to ensure your mind can change the world only when you intend it to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thought components are calculations you make to determine the forces you need to call upon. Perhaps you mentally weigh the mass of an object against the force of gravity to levitate it or you might determine exactly how much energy is needed for an object to combust. Calculation components tend to impart ordered visual and auditory effects to your spell manifestation, such as regular tessellations of light, mathematical spirals, or harmonic tones.</Description>

                <Description>The subconscious is by definition buried below the surface. Thus, only by stripping away the clamor and interference of everyday thought can you bring this more fundamental part of your mind to bear. Whether through sleep, self-hypnosis, or special exercises to empty your mind, you've found a way to access a deeper, more chaotic state of free association that better channels your psychic power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thought components come from your imagination, images, and sensations your mind freely associates. You might have a passing daydream of small creatures bringing you an object as you telekinetically attract it or you may blink to find you've teleported to your desired location. Spell manifestations from imagination components have surreal or indistinct qualities, and the exact details fade quickly from observers' memory, as sensations from a dream.</Description>

                            Your flights of imagination spill into the real world, causing you to become indistinct, hazy, or cloaked in figments. You become concealed until the start of your next turn. This concealment can't be used to Hide, as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious.

            <Ability name="The Distant Grasp" page="16">
                <Description>Motion characterizes the physicalâ€”a boulder falls, creatures move, the world turns. You believe the truest form of mind over matter is therefore to move things as well, wielding telekinesis as an arm that can grasp the furthest and finest of objects.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Mage Hand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your mage hand can carry up to 1 Bulk instead of only light Bulk. If the spell is heightened to 3rd level or higher, its maximum Bulk is 2. If the spell is heightened to 7th level or higher, its maximum Bulk is 3. It also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; You create a multitude of telekinetic hands that grip onto a creature and move it about. Target a creature of Medium size or smaller with the amped spell instead of an object. You attempt to Shove the target in a direction of your choice, rolling a spell attack roll against its Fortitude DC instead of an Athletics check. The creature takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the spell ends. Starting the round after you Cast the Spell, the first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to Shove the creature again.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (4th)&lt;/b&gt; You can attempt to Disarm the creature instead of attempting to Shove it. If you knock an item out of the creature's grasp in this way, the mage hand immediately grabs it. Any effect of the mage hand on the creature ends, and the spell now carries the item, just like you had picked it up with an unamped mage hand.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Telekinetic Projectile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your telekinetic projectiles can fly much further away. Increase the range of telekinetic projectile to 60 feet. It also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; You fling objects with even more force, driving your opponents backwards in a hail of objects. On a success, you push the target 5 feet away from you, and on a critical success, you push the target 10 feet away from you in addition to dealing double damage.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (+1)&lt;/b&gt; The damage increases by 2d6 instead of by 1d6.

                <Description>The true strength of the mind lies in the knowledge it contains, with each new observation contributing to the totality of its experiences. To grow your experiencesâ€”and with them, your powerâ€”you devote yourself to observing as much as possible, casting your senses through space and time with clairvoyance and precognition.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Detect Magic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    You have the kind of fine control that other spellcasters can only dream of. When you cast detect magic, you're aware of any creature in the emanation affected by a spell or carrying a magic item, and you determine the main location of magic within any magical hazard in the emanation (with the normal restrictions on detecting illusions). This typically manifests as an alteration to your vision, such as seeing a soft aura around the creature or hazard. Sensing these phenomena doesn't make it clear which spell is on a creature, nor which of its items are magical. Your detect magic also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Your pulse of detection magic helps you gain a sense of nearby magic's strengths or weaknesses. When you detect the presence of magic on an enemy or hazard, you gain a +1 status bonus to saves against magic originating from that enemy or hazard for 3 rounds. If you find magic from multiple sources with a single casting of detect magic, you get the bonus against all of them.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (7th)&lt;/b&gt;The status bonus to saves against magic increases to +2.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Guidance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    You have eyes everywhere, allowing you to guide people from a great distance. The range of guidance increases to 120 feet. It also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; You can project a flash of insight to your ally in the nick of time to save them from failure. Amped guidance doesn't cause a creature to become temporarily immune to guidance, and a creature can be targeted by amped guidance even if it is temporarily immune to guidance. You can cast an amped guidance spell as a reaction triggered when your ally fails or critically fails an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check, and the bonus from guidance would change the failure to a success or the critical failure to a normal failure. The bonus from guidance applies retroactively to their check.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (6th)&lt;/b&gt; The bonus from the spell increases to +2.

            <Ability name="The Oscillating Wave" page="19">
                <Description>At the heart of all things is energy. Though it may change its form or resting place, it is eternal, fundamental, the purest of building blocks. Your powers let you shift energyâ€”either concentrating it in a single point to explosive end or freezing objects by plundering it awayâ€” in an endless oscillation of temperature.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Conservation of Energy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Energy can't be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed. Whenever you use your magic to add or remove energy, you must then balance it with the opposing force. The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell or a standard psi cantrip from your conscious mind, decide whether you're adding energy or removing it. Once you add energy, you must remove energy the next time you cast one of these spells. When you Refocus, you restore yourself to a neutral state, allowing you to once again freely choose whether you add or remove energy on your next spell.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Adding Energy:&lt;/b&gt; The ability gains the fire trait, any damage it deals is fire damage, and any resistance it grants is to cold damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Removing Energy:&lt;/b&gt; The ability gains the cold trait, any damage it deals is cold damage, and any resistance it grants is to fire damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals. Fiery body grants ray of frost instead of produce flame when cast this way.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Mindshift:&lt;/b&gt; When you use an action that has the mindshift trait, you can choose to add or remove energy to it instead of making it mental. Alter it as normal for adding or removing energy and change any save it requires to a Reflex save.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Produce Flame&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    You can drastically increase the heat against adjacent targets. When using produce flame as a melee attack, increase the damage dice of the initial damage (but not the persistent damage) from d4s to d6s. Your produce flame also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; You project pure heat that causes a target to combust. The initial damage changes to 1d10 fire damage (not adding your ability modifier) plus 1 fire splash damage. When using amped produce flame as a melee attack, increase the damage dice of the initial damage from d10s to d12s. You are not harmed by splash damage from amped produce flame.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (+1)&lt;/b&gt;Instead of using produce flame's normal heightened entry, the initial damage increases by 1d10 (1d12 for melee) and the splash damage increases by 1. The persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Ray of Frost&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your ray of frost reaches even further. The range increases to 180 feet. Your ray of frost also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; You drain thermal energy at a distance, using what you plunder to replenish yourself. The ray deals 1d10 cold damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (+1)&lt;/b&gt; The initial damage increases by 1d10 instead of 1d4.

                <Description>Every mind murmurs constantly, and the static from those nearby reverberates in your head like wind through leaves. What better focus for your magic then, than the very thoughts of those around you? Your versatile telepathic abilities let you soothe and communicate with your allies or control your enemies.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Daze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    You can daze from a great distance. The range increases to 120 feet. Your daze also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Your spell cracks the target's mental defenses, leaving it susceptible to further psychic attack. The spell's damage changes to 1d10. If the target fails its Will save, until the end of its next turn, it gains weakness 1 to mental damage and takes a â€“1 status penalty to Will saves. On a critical failure, the weakness is 3 (in addition to the target being stunned 1). The weakness applies before daze deals damage.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (+2)&lt;/b&gt;The spell's damage increases by 2d10, and the weakness on a failure or critical failure increases by 1.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Message&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your message is not so easily bound by obstacles. The spell can travel up to 120 feet to reach the target, bending around walls and obstacles; this means you don't need a straight line of effect or line of sight to cast message as long as you know the target's space and there is an unblocked path of 120 feet or less that can reach them. It also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Your telepathic message allows you to coordinate your actions while you pass on information. The target of the message can immediately spend its reaction to Step or Stride.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (4th)&lt;/b&gt; The target of the message can choose to Shove, Strike, or Trip with its reaction instead.

            <Ability name="The Tangible Dream" page="21">
                <Description>You pull colors and shapes from the depth of your mind, projecting impossible creations into the world as tapestries of astral thread or sculptures of force and light.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Dancing Lights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your dancing lights can float wherever you like. After creating the lights, they can move more than 10 feet from the other lights, and more than 120 feet from you. Your dancing lights also gain the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Your lights whirl together, dazzlingly and hypnotically. When you amp the spell, you create a flashing display comprised of all four lights in an unoccupied 5-foot square. If you move the lights when you Sustain the Spell, the lights must remain together. The spell gains the visual trait. Each creature in a 5-foot emanation around the lights when you Cast the Spell must attempt a Fortitude save.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is dazzled until the start of your next turn and then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; The creature is dazzled until the start of your next turn and must attempt a new save against the spell whenever it starts its turn adjacent to the lights.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; As failure, but the creature is also fascinated by the lights until the start of your next turn.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Shield&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your shield spell can be deployed on behalf of others. When you cast shield, you can choose a target ally within 30 feet to gain the benefits of the spell instead of you. The option to Shield Block with the spell is up to you and uses your reaction, not the target's. Your shield also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; You create a layered barrier of three shields to improve your defenses. The duration increases to sustained up to 1 minute. The shield still lowers at the start of each of your turns, but you can raise it again when you Sustain the Spell. When you Shield Block with this spell, one of the three layers breaks and you cease to gain the bonus to AC, but the spell doesn't end. You can keep using the spell until the final layer breaks; once it does, the spell ends and you can't cast shield or amped shield again for 10 minutes. You can choose to break additional layers when you Shield Block with this spell to improve your defenses. If you break two layers instead of one, increase the Hardness to 1-1/2 Ã— the normal amount (7 at 1st level, 15 at 3rd level, 22 at 5th level, 30 at 7th level, and 37 at 9th level). If you break all three layers, increase the Hardness to double the normal amount.

                <Description>The mind can flit from thought to thought; why too shouldn't you? You focus on motion in a higher order of spatial dimensions, not just the typical three, allowing for versatile abilities that alter positioning.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Phase Bolt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    Your phase bolt temporarily sends the target's cover out of phase if it hits. On a success, reduce the target's circumstance bonus to AC (if any) by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. Your phase bolt also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Your bolt leaves phase completely, becoming invisible and intangible until it's already embedded in the targetâ€” giving the impression it simply teleported itself into place. The target is flat-footed against the attack. Additionally, the bolt ignores an amount of Hardness or resistance to piercing damage equal to half the spell's level. On a critical success, the target can't be affected by teleportation effects until the start of your next turn.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (+1)&lt;/b&gt; The bolt's damage increases by 2d4 instead of 1d4.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Warp Step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    You warp space more compactly, granting you a +10-foot status to your Speed instead of a +5-foot status bonus when you warp step. The spell also gains the following amp.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Space contracts with hardly a thought, letting you Cast the Spell as a single action.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Amp Heightened (4th)&lt;/b&gt; You twist space so completely you don't need to travel the interposing distance. You can choose to instead teleport to a space within your line of sight and line of effect with a range equal to your double your Speed (after applying the status bonus from warp step). This grants the spell the teleportation trait.

Whenever you would gain a benefit from a psychic amp, you can have the amp affect the tethered creature instead. You can do so only if the amp grants a distinct benefit, not if it alters the amped spell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tether can't be severed physically but breaks if the distance between you and the tethered ally ever exceeds 60 feet, if you become unconscious, or if you use Astral Tether again.</Description>

Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.&lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Choose one creature hit by the spell (if the spell has a spell attack roll) or that fails its save against the spell (if the spell requires a save). A psychic beacon emits from the creature's location, making it easier to notice the creature as the mind and attention of onlookers is subtly drawn to it. For 1 minute, if the target would be invisible, it's instead merely concealed, and if it would be concealed, it's no longer concealed.</Description>

You gain a 1st-level psi cantrip for a conscious mind other than your own; this can be either the unique surface cantrip or one of the common cantrips and the accompanying amp. If you choose a common cantrip, you also gain the special benefit granted by that conscious mind when casting the cantrip without an amp.

This applies while Searching, Seeking, and on the automatic secret check from Sixth Sense. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can't see them if they're more than 5 feet inside an object.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you notice a creature with your Sixth Sense, you also learn its location, making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.</Description>

            <Description>With a wresting of will, you siphon off a creature's mental energy to replenish your own. One non-mindless creature within 30 feet must attempt a Will save against your spell DC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 minute, and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to your normal maximum.

            <Trigger>You Unleash your Psyche.</Trigger>
            <Description>When you Unleash your Psyche, all your rage and painâ€”the portion of your psyche dedicated to cruel retributionâ€”come along with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The force of your dark persona's negativity batters constantly against all creatures in a 30-foot emanation when you Unleash your Psyche and for as long as your Psyche is Unleashed. A creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC the first time it enters the emanation, or if it's in the emanation when you take this action; it doesn't need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and returns. A creature frightened by your Dark Persona's Presence can't decrease its frightened value below 1 while within the emanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Success&lt;/b&gt; The creature is unaffected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt; The target is frightened 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; The target is frightened 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Failure&lt;/b&gt; The target is frightened 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While your Psyche is Unleashed, your dark persona cares only for destruction. You can Cast a Spell only if it can directly damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental condition or penalty on one.

            <Trigger>You roll a critical success on a Will save against a mental effect from a creature.</Trigger>
            <Description>Your thoughts sting back when a lesser mind tries to invade your own. You deal mental damage equal to your level to the triggering creature. If you so desire, you can also send the creature a single mental image to coincide with the damage, such as a watchful eye or the dread of floating in an infinite sea.</Description>

        <Ability name="Remove Presence" level="8" page="27">
            <Traits>Amp, Illusion, Mental, Occult, Psychic</Traits>
            <Description>Your spell reaches into the mind of a creature and removes you from it. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry.&lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Choose one target of the spell or one creature in its area. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you become undetected by that creature, disappearing from its senses for 1 minute or until you use a hostile action. This is similar to being invisible, but effects like see invisibility don't reveal youâ€”you're affecting the target's mind, not its vision. True seeing can still see through this illusion if the counteract check succeeds.</Description>

        <Ability name="Thoughtsense" level="8" page="27">
            <Traits>Divination, Mental, Occult, Psychic</Traits>
            <Description>You can detect the flickers of mental activity let off by all thinking creatures. You gain thoughtsense as a vague sense that has a range of 30 feetâ€”like all vague senses, it's only about as precise as an average human's sense of smell, meaning you generally can predict only if a creature is present. Your thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature that is unthinking or otherwise immune to mental effects (such as many constructs and oozes) can't be perceived using your thoughtsense, regardless of how precise it is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While your Psyche is Unleashed, your thoughtsense upgrades to an imprecise sense, letting you use it to Seek out creatures.</Description>

        <Ability name="Whispering Steps" level="8" page="27">
            <Traits>Amp, Enchantment, Mental, Occult, Psychic</Traits>
            <Description>Your spell leaves a lingering connection between you and a creatureâ€”one through which you can nudge the creature's mind this way or that. The amped cantrip must take 2 or more actions to cast, target one or more creatures, and either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry.&lt;b&gt;Amp&lt;/b&gt; Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the creature's mind, forcing it to Step in a direction of your choosing; as this is forced movement, you can't force the creature to Step into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or the like. After it Steps, the creature becomes temporarily immune to this amp for 24 hours.</Description>
