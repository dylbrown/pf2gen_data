	<Usage>worn</Usage>
	<Description>Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

You don’t need to eat or drink while this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; is invested by you. This &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t function until it has been worn continuously for a week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by someone else, this interval starts over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast &lt;i&gt;air bubble&lt;/i&gt; as a primal innate spell once per day. &lt;br&gt;</Description>

A &lt;i&gt;dull gray aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; has lost its special magical properties, sometimes as a result of overusing a &lt;i&gt;tourmaline sphere&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. It still orbits your head like any other &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; and can thus serve as a stylish, hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like &lt;i&gt;continual flame&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dull gray aeon stones&lt;/i&gt; have no resonant power.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

When a &lt;i&gt;gold nodule aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; is created, its creator chooses a language they know to store within the crystal. When you invest the stone, you gain the ability to understand, speak, and write that language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast &lt;i&gt;comprehend language&lt;/i&gt; as an occult innate spell once per day.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

This functions as a &lt;i&gt;pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, but it casts an 8th-level &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; spell with a counteract modifier of +31.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;read aura&lt;/i&gt; as arcane innate spells at will.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

An &lt;i&gt;orange prism aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; must be activated to provide a benefit.

This can be used only on spells that specifically target you—not area spells that don’t have targets. If it succeeds, it counteracts the spell for all targets if other creatures were targeted in addition to you. Each time you activate this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, attempt a DC 5 flat check.

When you invest this stone, you gain 15 temporary Hit Points. If the stone’s effects are suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit Points remaining until it returns. The temporary Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations; they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or invest another &lt;i&gt;pink rhomboid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, before then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast the &lt;i&gt;stabilize&lt;/i&gt; cantrip as a divine innate spell.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

When you would die from the dying condition (typically at dying 4), this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; automatically activates and reduces your dying value to 1 less than would normally kill you (typically to dying 3). The stone then permanently turns into a &lt;i&gt;dull gray aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. You can benefit from this ability only once per day, even if you have multiple such stones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level &lt;i&gt;heal&lt;/i&gt; as a divine innate spell once per day.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An indentation in the middle of the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold a single &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. Placing an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; slotted in a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; also grants its resonant power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you have more than one &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; with an invested &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, just not in &lt;i&gt;wayfinders&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] command; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; is targeted by a 1st-level &lt;i&gt;light&lt;/i&gt; spell.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. Activating an &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; counts against the limit of one &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; with a slotted resonant &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. &lt;br&gt;

 blend a few Arcadian secrets into the original &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; design, allowing the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; to gain mobility for a time and act as a spy. In addition to the effects of a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;, a &lt;i&gt;hummingbird wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; has the following activation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] command, Interact; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per hour; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You cause the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; to transform into a Tiny bee hummingbird, only 2 inches long. Other than the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; being a visible bird, this has the effects of &lt;i&gt;prying eye&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to Seeking through the hummingbird, you can activate any &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; within the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; as if the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; were still on your person. When the effect ends, the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; transforms back to normal in its current position. Damaging the bird ends the effect but does not destroy the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.</Description>

	<Description>Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets.

You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

You don’t need to eat or drink while this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; is invested by you. This &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t function until it has been worn continuously for a week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by someone else, this interval starts over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast &lt;i&gt;air bubble&lt;/i&gt; as a primal innate spell once per day. &lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

When you invest this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, it slowly starts healing your wounds, restoring 1 HP every minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power grants you resistance 1 to negative damage.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

This &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; allows you to cast the 1st-level &lt;i&gt;shield&lt;/i&gt; cantrip as an arcane innate spell, surrounding yourself in pink energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power increases the damage prevented by your &lt;i&gt;aeon stone's shield&lt;/i&gt; spell from 5 to 10.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

The first time each day you die, your vital and spiritual essences mingle together and reside within this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. You have a limited sense of how many life forces are currently within 30 feet of the stone, which you can potentially use to determine when it's safe to call on the stone's power. At any time within the next hour after your body died, you can spend 1 minute concentrating in order to return to your body. As long as your body is still intact, you are no longer dead— you are restored to 1 HP with the doomed 3 and wounded 3 conditions. You can benefit from the effects of only one &lt;i&gt;pale orange rhomboid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; in a given day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to wait more than an hour to return to your body with the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;; as long as the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; remains on the body, your body doesn't decay and you can return at any point.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An indentation in the middle of the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold a single &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. Placing an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; slotted in a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; also grants its resonant power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you have more than one &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; with an invested &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them.

An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it.

An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; counts against the limit of one &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; with a slotted resonant &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>Worn on a necklace, this intricate key grants you greater facility with constructs. The key alerts you to constructs lurking around you. Whether or not you are Investigating, the GM automatically rolls secret Recall Knowledge checks for you when you see a construct pretending to be a normal object, statue, or the like. Typically, this check is Arcana, Crafting, or an appropriate Lore skill. On a success, you recognize the presence of the construct and gain the usual benefits of Recall Knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While you're wearing the key, if your attack reduces a construct to 0 Hit Points, instead of destroying it completely, you can send it into a dormant state, from which you can study its inner workings and possibly (at the GM's discretion) spend time and money to reprogram or repurpose it. Even if you don't subvert it, you can Repair a construct rendered dormant this way, allowing you to return tomb guardians to their vigil after you've battled them. Additionally, you can activate the key in two ways to call a construct to serve you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] command, Interact; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per hour; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You turn the key in the air and create a magic glyph.

Placing an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily.

Worn on a chain around the neck, a &lt;i&gt;Razmiri wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass and provides its wearer a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie or Impersonate. &lt;i&gt;Razmiri wayfinders&lt;/i&gt; can also be used to grant temporary healing, making it easier for the wearer to impersonate a divine spellcaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] envision; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; three times per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You touch an adjacent creature, granting them 3d8 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] manipulate; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You touch an adjacent creature and attempt a counteract check against one poison or disease afflicting the creature. On a success, you halt the effects of the poison or disease for 1 day, rather than removing it. This temporarily relieves any penalties imposed by the affliction but doesn't cure the effect or count against its duration; the poison or disease is merely halted for a time, and it resumes where it left off once this effect ends. &lt;br&gt;</Description>

Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

When you invest this stone, you gain 15 temporary Hit Points. If the stone’s effects are suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit Points remaining until it returns. The temporary Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations; they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or invest another &lt;i&gt;pink rhomboid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, before then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast the &lt;i&gt;stabilize&lt;/i&gt; cantrip as a divine innate spell.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

When you would die from the dying condition (typically at dying 4), this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; automatically activates and reduces your dying value to 1 less than would normally kill you (typically to dying 3). The stone then permanently turns into a &lt;i&gt;dull gray aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. You can benefit from this ability only once per day, even if you have multiple such stones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level &lt;i&gt;heal&lt;/i&gt; as a divine innate spell once per day.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

A &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An indentation in the middle of the &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold a single &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. Placing an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily.

Worn on a chain around the neck, a &lt;i&gt;Razmiri wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; functions as a compass and provides its wearer a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie or Impersonate. &lt;i&gt;Razmiri wayfinders&lt;/i&gt; can also be used to grant temporary healing, making it easier for the wearer to impersonate a divine spellcaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] envision; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; three times per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You touch an adjacent creature, granting them 3d8 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] manipulate; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You touch an adjacent creature and attempt a counteract check against one poison or disease afflicting the creature. On a success, you halt the effects of the poison or disease for 1 day, rather than removing it. This temporarily relieves any penalties imposed by the affliction but doesn't cure the effect or count against its duration; the poison or disease is merely halted for a time, and it resumes where it left off once this effect ends. &lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>Worn on a necklace, this intricate key grants you greater facility with constructs. The key alerts you to constructs lurking around you. Whether or not you are Investigating, the GM automatically rolls secret Recall Knowledge checks for you when you see a construct pretending to be a normal object, statue, or the like. Typically, this check is Arcana, Crafting, or an appropriate Lore skill. On a success, you recognize the presence of the construct and gain the usual benefits of Recall Knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While you're wearing the key, if your attack reduces a construct to 0 Hit Points, instead of destroying it completely, you can send it into a dormant state, from which you can study its inner workings and possibly (at the GM's discretion) spend time and money to reprogram or repurpose it. Even if you don't subvert it, you can Repair a construct rendered dormant this way, allowing you to return tomb guardians to their vigil after you've battled them. Additionally, you can activate the key in two ways to call a construct to serve you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] command, Interact; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per hour; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You turn the key in the air and create a magic glyph.

An &lt;i&gt;archaic wayfinder&lt;/i&gt; can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power.

	<Description>Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are various types of &lt;i&gt;aeon stones&lt;/i&gt;, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a &lt;i&gt;wayfinder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

This aeon stone must be activated to provide a benefit. The resonant power allows you to cast the &lt;i&gt;read aura&lt;/i&gt; cantrip as an arcane innate spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [[Reaction]] envision; &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per day; &lt;b&gt;Trigger&lt;/b&gt; A spell targets you; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The stone casts a 6th-level &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; spell in an attempt to counteract the triggering spell, with a counteract modifier of +22. This can be used only on spells that specifically target you—not area spells that don’t have targets. If it succeeds, it counteracts the spell for all targets if other creatures were targeted in addition to you. Each time you activate this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the stone permanently turns into a &lt;i&gt;dull gray aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

When you invest this stone, you gain 15 temporary Hit Points. If the stone’s effects are suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit Points remaining until it returns. The temporary Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations; they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or invest another &lt;i&gt;pink rhomboid aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;, before then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast the &lt;i&gt;stabilize&lt;/i&gt; cantrip as a divine innate spell.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

When you would die from the dying condition (typically at dying 4), this &lt;i&gt;aeon stone&lt;/i&gt; automatically activates and reduces your dying value to 1 less than would normally kill you (typically to dying 3). The stone then permanently turns into a &lt;i&gt;dull gray aeon stone&lt;/i&gt;. You can benefit from this ability only once per day, even if you have multiple such stones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level &lt;i&gt;heal&lt;/i&gt; as a divine innate spell once per day.&lt;br&gt;</Description>
