	<Name>Bookthief Brew</Name>
	<Price>3 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>This concoction mixes into a thick, paste-like substance when shaken. When exposed to air, the substance dries after one minute. If poured over a book, scroll, or other material featuring words written in ink, the brew will make an exact copy of the words it is in contact with while it dries, though it doesn't contain any magical effect or other special properties of the original words. Once dried, you can remove the dried substance as an Interact action. A single vial of bookthief brew can coat two pages from a book, a single scroll, or a similar amount of area for other surfaces, producing a dried sheet as thick as a piece of paper. Unfortunately, the sheet's copy is flipped, requiring a mirror to properly read.</Description>

	<Price>10 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable, Precious</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>You can pour a vial of this dark liquid onto one melee weapon, one thrown weapon, or 10 pieces of ammunition. When used on a melee or thrown weapon, rather than ammunition, the blanch lasts for the listed duration or 10 successful Strikes, whichever comes first. When you use it on ammunition, the blanch is expended on a given piece of ammunition after firing it, whether it hits or not. A cold iron blanch contains small amounts of alchemist's fire, so it must be used all at once; an opened vial ignites to melt the cold iron onto the weapon and is quickly consumed. The weapon or ammunition counts as cold iron instead of its normal precious material (such as silver) for any physical damage it deals, if applicable.&lt;br&gt;

The blanch provides low-grade cold iron, so you can use it on a magic weapon up to 8th level, or ammunition for such a weapon. It lasts for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Name>Quickpatch Glue</Name>
	<Price>10 gp</Price>
	<Bulk>L</Bulk>
	<Traits>Alchemical, Consumable</Traits>
	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>Quickpatch glue is a fast-setting adhesive designed for rapid but temporary repairs. When applied to a broken item, the glue adheres the item's pieces back together. This does not restore the item's hit points, but it allows the item to be used for its normal function and removes the broken condition. The glue is fragile and degrades over time. An item repaired by quickpatch glue regains the broken condition after it takes damage or 1 hour passes (whichever comes first). In order to apply a new vial of quickpatch glue to or repair the item, the item's holder must first remove the glue residue, a process that requires 10 minutes of effort and a set of alchemist's tools.</Description>

	<Description>This sphere contains small fragments of thunderstones within a colloidal suspension of a precious metal.

Any creature with a weakness to the precious metal that starts its turn in the mist takes damage equal to its weakness. The mist lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. Most metalmist spheres are filled with silver or cold iron, but more expensive versions containing other ingredients might exist.&lt;br&gt;

	<Usage>held in 1 hand</Usage>
	<Description>You can pour a vial of this dark liquid onto one melee weapon, one thrown weapon, or 10 pieces of ammunition. When used on a melee or thrown weapon, rather than ammunition, the blanch lasts for the listed duration or 10 successful Strikes, whichever comes first. When you use it on ammunition, the blanch is expended on a given piece of ammunition after firing it, whether it hits or not. A cold iron blanch contains small amounts of alchemist's fire, so it must be used all at once; an opened vial ignites to melt the cold iron onto the weapon and is quickly consumed. The weapon or ammunition counts as cold iron instead of its normal precious material (such as silver) for any physical damage it deals, if applicable.&lt;br&gt;

The blanch provides low-grade cold iron, so you can use it on a magic weapon up to 8th level, or ammunition for such a weapon. It lasts for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;</Description>

	<Description>This glass sphere is divided into four quarters, each of which contains a different material aligned with good, evil, chaos, or law, such as shavings from a holy relic or dried flowers that grew near a planar rift to the Abyss. When an alignment ampoule strikes a creature with a weakness to good, evil, chaos, or law, it deals the listed damage, which matches the creature's highest weakness. This damage is always based on the weaknesses of the initial target of the attack. If a creature has multiple eligible weaknesses, randomly determine the damage type. An alignment ampoule has no effect against creatures that don't have a weakness to the ampoule's associated alignment types.&lt;br&gt;

You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 3d4 damage and 4 splash damage.</Description>

	<Description>No one is sure if Gorm brews this malty ale himself, but it seems to be an off-duty favorite of the Grand Archive faction leader. The brew packs a heavy punch, and while Gorm officially discourages drinking on the job, boulderhead bock does makes the drinker more self-assured and protects them from conditions that would addle their mental faculties. For 1 hour, you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or stupefied. However, you also become less aware of your surroundings, taking a –2 item penalty to Perception for 1 hour.</Description>
