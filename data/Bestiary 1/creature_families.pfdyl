        <Name>Aeon</Name>
        <Description>Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others— they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.&lt;h3&gt;Aeon Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.&lt;h3&gt;Other Aeons&lt;/h3&gt;Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.&lt;h3&gt;Paradox and Unity&lt;/h3&gt;To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.</Description>

        <Name>Alghollthu</Name>
        <Description>In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again—this time without alghollthu influence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.&lt;h3&gt;Alghollthu Domains&lt;/h3&gt;The ruling castes of the alghollthu species dwell in oceanic depths or underground waterways, while their servitors like ulat-kinis and ugothols can often be found in coastal regions and marshes.&lt;h3&gt;Alghollthu Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Although most alghollthus lack the greed that tempts most mortals, they do gather wealth and magical tools to use in their schemes. A given aboleth or veiled master might also wear magical jewelry and other objects. Faceless stalkers and other humanoid servants of alghollthus use weapons and armor, such as the faceless stalker’s sword or ulat-kini’s trident, as well as other tools. These servitor races can be as acquisitive as other humanoids.&lt;h3&gt;Other Alghollthus&lt;/h3&gt;While the veiled masters are the rulers of alghollthu society, they are not the most powerful of their kind. Greater, more mysterious creatures that function as organic thought networks, immense aquatic engines of war, or specialized extractors of forgotten secrets dwell among their sunken cities. Meanwhile, the world above remains infested with creatures that were originally created by the alghollthus but have long since drifted away from their aquatic progenitors to become their own sinister monstrosities.</Description>

        <Name>Angel</Name>
        <Description>The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels, including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.&lt;h3&gt;Angelic Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.&lt;h3&gt;Angelic Locations&lt;/h3&gt;Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.&lt;h3&gt;Angelic Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.&lt;h3&gt;Other Angels&lt;/h3&gt;The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.&lt;h3&gt;What is a Deva?&lt;/h3&gt;Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.</Description>

        <Name>Animated Object</Name>
        <Description>Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.&lt;h3&gt;Animating Objects&lt;/h3&gt;Most animated objects encountered by adventurers are permanently animated creatures, either created by rituals or given life by infusions of positive energy. Restless spirits, certain ghosts, and other haunting undead influences can also give rise to animated objects, although in cases like the poltergeist, what appears to be an animated object may merely be an evil force using its magic to hurl furnishings about as weapons.&lt;h3&gt;Guarded Treasures&lt;/h3&gt;Animated objects are mindless constructs. While this leaves them no concept of the value of treasure, they are often used as guardians for vaults or repositories of valuables. In these cases, the treasures they guard can vary wildly, but should be of a value appropriate for the animated object’s level.</Description>

        <Description>Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.&lt;h3&gt;Ankhrav Burrows&lt;/h3&gt;As if the appearance of a hungry ankhrav in a stretch of farmland isn’t bad enough, it almost always indicates the proximity of an ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing number of ankhravs can infest a lair. However, adventurers brave enough to crawl through the tangled burrows are often rewarded with large amounts of treasure as ankhravs have a habit of dragging their victims back to the deepest corners of their den to feast, usually discarding the remains with most of the gear intact.</Description>

        <Name>Arboreal</Name>
        <Description>Arboreals are guardians of the forest and representatives of the trees. As longlived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to fight in defense of the woods. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of short-lived folk—even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals—and have an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands. Against those who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals’ wrath is unwavering and devastating. Perhaps ironically, arboreals are gifted at tearing down what others build—a trait that serves vengeful members of their kind well.&lt;h3&gt;Felled Arboreals&lt;/h3&gt;Arboreals have a great respect for dead members of their species. Their elaborate burial rituals involve laying the fallen arboreal down in a mossy bed in the center of a grove of saplings. The decomposing arboreal nourishes the saplings, ensuring the growth of a new generation of trees.&lt;h3&gt;Fungus Network&lt;/h3&gt;Particularly old arboreal regents and other powerful arboreals can tap into the extensive network of fungus that connects the roots of all the trees in the forest. By doing so, the arboreal can learn of threats throughout the entire woodland, even from miles away.</Description>

        <Name>Archon</Name>
        <Description>Archons are guardians of Heaven and enemies of chaos and evil. They openly fight back the spread of fiends but also quietly nurture the seeds of virtue within mortals, teaching the denizens of the Material Plane how to act with honor and integrity, enact just laws, and cast off sin and temptation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.&lt;h3&gt;Archon Aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.&lt;h3&gt;Archon Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.&lt;h3&gt;Archon Evolutions&lt;/h3&gt;When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.&lt;h3&gt;Archon Locations&lt;/h3&gt;While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.&lt;h3&gt;Armored Archons&lt;/h3&gt;Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.&lt;h3&gt;Heavenly Mountain&lt;/h3&gt;Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.&lt;h3&gt;Other Archons&lt;/h3&gt;Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.</Description>

        <Name>Azata</Name>
        <Description>Azatas are manifestations of freedom—kindly celestials with a penchant for curious exploration, spontaneous revelry, and whimsical quests. Born of the untamable wilds of Elysium, azatas are passionate and mercurial, but also fiercely loyal to those they hold dear. Azatas act quickly and directly against fiendish and otherworldly influences, but they tend to stay out of mortal affairs otherwise, allowing them the ultimate freedom to choose their own destiny. While all azatas cherish freedom, each type exemplifies a particular freedom above others. Many of their kind hold strange knightly and courtly titles that defy mortal classification and shift and change with time and on different occasions rather than following a strict hierarchy. This baf  es archons and other more lawful creatures who haven’t had much contact with azatas. In actuality, the azatas use their titles as personal flourishes and points of pride, rather than as excuses to order each other around.&lt;h3&gt;Azata Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.&lt;h3&gt;Azata Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur. They might explain away bejeweled weapons as necessary tools against the forces of evil, or the wild array of jewelry and silks they wear as important diplomatic tools.&lt;h3&gt;Other Azatas&lt;/h3&gt;The wilds of Elysium play host to a wide array of azatas, the most varied and widespread of the celestials. From the four-eyed mothlike uinuja to the supernaturally verdant and beautiful veranallia, whose lower body is a wondrous garden of wildflowers and plant life, azatas are nothing if not diverse!&lt;h3&gt;Wandering Azatas&lt;/h3&gt;While the idyllic realm of Elysium is the home plane of azatas, their overwhelming curiosity and natural wanderlust often lead them to travel far from this plane. On other planes, they can be seeking to right wrongs, looking for entertainment, or merely exploring to see the sights. More than a few azatas, taken by a whimsical urge to spread their sometimes unwelcome jocosity, see it as their duty to tease uptight or humorless mortal creatures.</Description>

        <Name>Barghest</Name>
        <Description>Barghests are lupine fiends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago, barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests’ loyalties and philosophical nature changed significantly. Today, while barghests retain their connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites.&lt;h3&gt;Barghest Cults&lt;/h3&gt;The barghest hero-gods may be the only ones of their kind capable of granting spells to their clerics, but the idea of adoring worshippers appeals to all barghests. A barghest that completes its transformation into a greater barghest, and thus is no longer morbidly distracted by its hunger, often plays the role of a deity to ignorant groups of goblins or other monsters. To them, the fact that the barghest can’t grant spells is irrelevant—rather, their veneration is due the fact that worshipping the barghest is the best way to keep it from devouring the entire tribe.&lt;h3&gt;Barghest Hero-Gods&lt;/h3&gt;The four barghests stolen from Hell’s kennels by the deity Lamashtu were not the originals of their kind, but they were then and remain today the most powerful. Now they are denizens of the Abyss, dwelling in their own realm adjacent to Lamashtu’s domain, and are heavily worshipped by goblins across multiple worlds as “hero-gods.” These four barghests include Hadregash the slaver, Venkelvore the torturer, Zarongel the dog slayer, and Zogmugot the scavenger.</Description>

Giant bats prefer to dwell in smaller numbers in deep caves, abandoned mines, or the attics of abandoned buildings. Even larger species dwell in the deeper regions of the Darklands, where they are often used as mounts, or even ritualistically slaughtered and then animated as specialized undead guardians of eerie underground cities and nations.</Description>

And the truly immense goliath beetles can devastate entire buildings or even castles with frightening ease. &lt;h3&gt;Beetle Treasures&lt;/h3&gt;Beetles do not collect treasure, but the two light-producing organs of a flash beetle can be recovered from the creature and used for illumination-based chemical recipes, spell components, and magic item creation. </Description>

Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger.&lt;h3&gt;Boar Locations&lt;/h3&gt;Boars can be found in almost any environment, from forests to deserts, warm or cold, including even high-altitude mountainous regions. They tend to prefer forests, marshes, and meadows. Daeodons are likewise found in such regions but generally prefer remote reaches far from civilization. &lt;h3&gt;Boar Resources&lt;/h3&gt;A boar's carcass typically provides enough meat for 100 meals or more, as well as hide and bristles that can be used for crafting.</Description>

Over 3 years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare—everything needed to survive in their might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.&lt;h3&gt;Boggard Villages&lt;/h3&gt;Boggards prefer to dwell in swamplands and mires. Though they are at home in the water, they prefer to spend most of their lives on land, and build villages of mud huts.

Each caligni serves in a specific role and grows into a specific form as determined by supernatural traditions and influences in caligni society. Regardless of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale flesh and white eyes. Some surface dwellers call the caligni “dark folk,” a term they dislike because it doesn’t reflect either their appearance or character, only their environment.&lt;h3&gt;Caligni Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Many calignis hide shiny baubles and trinkets beneath their dark rags, keeping them out of sight of their greedy kin. They also keep several doses of black smear poison on hand to incapacitate foes. &lt;h3&gt;The Caligni Legacy&lt;/h3&gt;The calignis are descendants of humans who, millennia ago, fled underground to escape a devastating cataclysm and begged malevolent, shadowy demigods known only as the Forsaken for salvation. The Forsaken warped the refugees into tough survivors, but at a price: every caligni that dies combusts in a burst of energy that provides a scrap of soul energy to the Forsaken. The greatest irony of the caligni's bargain is that the Forsaken themselves mysteriously vanished long ago and no longer answer pleas or prayers.

Male mountain lions lack the mane of their somewhat larger grassland-dwelling kin, but are no less dangerous.&lt;br&gt; While tigers are most common in forests, they also inhabit grasslands and savannas as long as vegetation is dense, and their dens are often found in caves.&lt;br&gt; Smilodons live in wooded and grassland areas.&lt;h3&gt;Domesticating Big Cats&lt;/h3&gt;While it's common practice to keep a house cat in the home to ward off unwanted rodents, keeping a big cat for a pet is a different matter entirely. Nevertheless, up-and-coming merchant lords, impetuous princes and princesses, and status-obsessed nobles have tried to do just that, often resulting only in terrified house staff and ruined upholstery. Many among the idle rich will gladly pay for the services of an unscrupulous druid or ranger who promises to help them achieve their dreams of an oversized feline friend, but the dire risks of such an endeavor are enough to dissuade even the greediest would-be animal trainers from even attempting the feat.</Description>

        <Name>Catfolk</Name>
        <Description>Lithe and agile, with catlike features and long tails, the amurruns are wanderers, explorers, and extroverts who share a gregarious nature and an unbridled curiosity. This latter characteristic leads many individual amurruns into trouble, yet this inquisitiveness is paired with a penchant for good fortune that offsets much of their self-induced peril. They accept the term “catfolk” as a name for their people with grace and a hint of amusement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone catfolk can be found anywhere in the world, but it’s rare to find a settlement beyond their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable wonder. As many a catfolk might say, “I’ve lived with my people my whole life, but you? You’re new and different! There’s so much to learn from you!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were first created as guardians and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces that exist at its fringes. Often, this charge manifests as a longstanding opposition to cultists of demon lords, archdevils, and other fiendish demigods. Many catfolk worship the spirits of creation, using serendipitous rituals to attract good fortune and banish ill luck in the spirits’ name, while others venerate their own small pantheon of divinities. Those who travel often find comfort in the worship of Desna, whose teachings closely match their own predilections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Catfolk adapt well to adventuring roles, and can be quite diverse in their areas of study and specialization. Those who follow the traditions of rangers and rogues are perhaps the most commonly encountered, but not overwhelmingly so. Their natural curiosity leads some catfolk to take up mystical arts, training as wizards or following a divine path to become clerics.&lt;h3&gt;The Catfolk Nation&lt;/h3&gt;Catfolk claim to hail from a faroff nation called Murraseth in southern Garund. It is a nation rumored to hold a dark secret at its center, the details of which its discreet inhabitants do not willingly divulge to outsiders. Indeed, few adventurers from the Inner Sea region have managed to gain entrance to Murraseth, let alone discover any of its mysteries.</Description>

        <Name>Cave Worm</Name>
        <Description>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world, eating whatever material they find. Named for their distinctive colorations, these worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.&lt;h3&gt;Belly of the Beast&lt;/h3&gt;The adventure need not end simply because the party was ingloriously swallowed whole by a giant cave worm. Perhaps the PCs find an undigested item that helps them survive the inhospitable environ, or maybe the worm regurgitates them in a cavern far off from where they started. Whatever the specifics, you can easily draw from folklore and popular fiction to create your own "belly of the worm" adventure for heroes who wind up on the wrong side of the monster’s scales.&lt;h3&gt;Cave Worm Guardians&lt;/h3&gt;Cave worms are notoriously dim witted, driven primarily by purely animalistic needs to feed and reproduce. This hasn’t prevented attempts to use them as guardians for their lairs, if not to tame them. Magic can be used to maintain control over a worm, but gifted, patient, and brave animal trainers can condition cave worms to serve in all manner of roles, such as living siege engines, shocking methods of executing foes, or merely pets.&lt;h3&gt;Notorious Worms&lt;/h3&gt;Some societies view the immense cave worms as natural disasters or incarnations of wrathful gods. Cave worms that have been active in a region often become part of that area’s local lore. For example, in the notorious Cinderlands of eastern Varisia, Shoanti have long told tales of Cindermaw, an immense crimson worm viewed by some as worthy of worship, and by others as the ultimate test of bravery.&lt;h3&gt;Ravenous Tunnelers&lt;/h3&gt;Cave worms are infamous for being nearly unstoppable and for swallowing their prey whole. A cave worm also ingests earth and minerals as it tunnels. The worm processes some of these minerals, resulting in its armored hide and toxic sting, while it leaves others behind—often including treasure or other valuables that incidentally serve to lure explorers into the worm’s proximity and, more often than not, its gullet. While not completely mindless, cave worms are difficult to train, and most attempts to domesticate them (in theory, a cave worm would make an excellent mining resource) result in disaster.</Description>

        <Name>Centipede</Name>
        <Description>Hunters and scavengers that live amid dung and detritus, centipedes are a relatively common and often reviled threat faced by adventurers. Scurrying about with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles to slow and torment their prey with a vicious toxin before they settle down to feed in slow and disgusting leisure.&lt;h3&gt;Centipede Species&lt;/h3&gt;Centipedes take nearly countless forms amid nearly every climate, with specific traits and abilities varying wildly between species. Tangled forests, arid deserts, foul sewers, deep caverns, and abandoned buildings are all common haunts for centipedes, from oversized specimens capable of taking down significant prey alone to carpets of frenzied vermin gathered into a dangerous swarm. Larger and more specialized centipedes than the two presented here exist, such as the sleek giant whiptail centipede or the immense titan centipede.&lt;h3&gt;Massive Myriapods&lt;/h3&gt;All centipedes prefer to eat carrion, gathering in numbers around large corpses or battlefields and jealously guarding their troves of flesh from any who would disturb them. Monstrous centipedes are also aggressive hunters and are particularly fond of devouring horses and similar creatures, often snatching a mount right out from under its rider. They are unusually stealthy for creatures of their size, making their swift strikes all the more frightening.</Description>

        <Name>Changeling</Name>
        <Description>Children of hags, destined to become hags themselves, changelings face a life of conflict. Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes, orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia, leading to widespread superstition about individuals with differently colored eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag. As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings find themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or primal magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings— women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag’s coven, where they are subjected to terrible rituals that twist them into hags themselves. Some changelings, especially those who have strong social bonds or embrace druidic traditions, are able to resist this Call and continue on with their mortal lives. The fact that the Call disproportionately targets female changelings has led to a widespread misunderstanding that all changelings are female, while in fact male changelings are simply assumed to be members of their paternal ancestry.&lt;h3&gt;Changeling Exiles&lt;/h3&gt;Changelings who resist the Call and abandon the society that raised them become exiles like the one presented on this page—creatures who live solitary lives in the wild and are often driven to desperate measures to survive, taking up the lifestyles of highway bandits or risk-taking wilderness guides.</Description>

        <Description>The cyclopes are violent giants with a tragic past. Although they possess only one eye, they could once see far more than most, possessing occult wisdom and divinatory magic that gave them the mystic ability of foresight. But their legendary oracular powers failed to prevent the fall of their society, and the vast kingdoms of the cyclops long ago collapsed into ruin. Today, cyclopes have forgotten much of what they once knew, and they skulk among the crumbling remains of their fallen cities like forgotten kings and queens gone mad.&lt;h3&gt;Cyclops Seers&lt;/h3&gt;Great cyclopes are traditionally violent creatures, but some retain fragments of the old ways that lull them into periods of calm. During such times, they can be incredible sources of information, but one must take care to be well away from the great cyclops’s lair before its bestial rage wakens once more.&lt;h3&gt;Lost Civilizations&lt;/h3&gt;Cyclopes dwell in or near the remains of their lost civilizations—notably Ghol-Gan in Garund, Koloran in northwestern Casmaron, and various kingdoms in Iblydos. Ruins of Ghol-Gan still dot the archipelago of the Shackles, and untold numbers of treasures belonging to the ancient cyclops empire still await discovery. Pirates and treasure hunters regularly conduct expeditions in search of lost Ghol-Gani relics, but many of these voyages never return. Among those that do, survivors speak of terrible curses, gruesome traps, and one-eyed undead guardians.</Description>

        <Name>Daemon</Name>
        <Description>Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”&lt;h3&gt;Abaddon&lt;/h3&gt;Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.&lt;h3&gt;Daemon Harbingers&lt;/h3&gt;The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.&lt;h3&gt;Daemonic Deacons&lt;/h3&gt;Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.&lt;h3&gt;Daemonic Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.&lt;h3&gt;Other Daemons&lt;/h3&gt;As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.&lt;h3&gt;Soul Gems as Gear&lt;/h3&gt;Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like &lt;i&gt;bind soul&lt;/i&gt;. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.&lt;h3&gt;Soul Gems as Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.&lt;h3&gt;The Daemonic Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.</Description>

        <Name>Deep Gnome</Name>
        <Description>These distant cousins to gnomes are reclusive, underground dwellers. Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes’ relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar (pages 138–139) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views. Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through their hair.&lt;h3&gt;Deep Gnome Faith&lt;/h3&gt;While most deep gnomes aren’t particularly religious, they respect the spirits of nature, especially those found within earth and stone. Most deep gnome druids, known as “rockwardens,” learn Terran, the language of the Plane of Earth, in order to speak with these forces, and some can even entreat with earth elementals. The handful of deep gnome communities of faith tend to worship neutral deities, such as Gozreh, Nethys, Pharasma, and the gnomish goddess Nivi Rhombodazzle. In such areas, a small church to the worshipped god is erected in the center of town and is open to the public around the clock, allowing the deep gnomes to worship as they see fit.&lt;h3&gt;Few Friends Below&lt;/h3&gt;Most who dwell in the Darklands are sinister and cruel. While deep gnomes are not, those who seek their aid should remember that they don’t welcome strangers with open arms. In the brutal Darklands, such traits are seized upon by its denizens and treated as much as weaknesses as they are strengths.</Description>

        <Name>Demon</Name>
        <Description>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon’s driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.&lt;h3&gt;Conjuring Demons&lt;/h3&gt;Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and &lt;i&gt;summon fiend&lt;/i&gt; for combat applications. For &lt;i&gt;planar ally&lt;/i&gt;, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.&lt;h3&gt;Demonic Deities&lt;/h3&gt;The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.&lt;h3&gt;Demonic Locations&lt;/h3&gt;The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.&lt;h3&gt;Demonic Possession&lt;/h3&gt;Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.&lt;h3&gt;Demonic Sources&lt;/h3&gt;When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.&lt;h3&gt;Half-Demons&lt;/h3&gt;The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.&lt;h3&gt;Other Demons&lt;/h3&gt;The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.&lt;h3&gt;Sinful Destruction&lt;/h3&gt;While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Chaos&lt;/h3&gt;Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.&lt;h3&gt;What Makes a Sin?&lt;/h3&gt;Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.</Description>

        <Description>Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin, and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world’s surface races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 pounds.&lt;h3&gt;Cytillesh&lt;/h3&gt;Deros grow and ingest a poisonous fungus called cytillesh, also known as brain mold. Cytillesh gives off a pale blue glow and can cause birth defects and various adverse effects. Deros aren’t fazed by these detriments, as prolonged exposure can also slow the effects of aging and, in rare cases, provide occult powers to certain individuals known as “magisters.” Deros can also brew cytillesh spores into a poison that creates delusions and hallucinations.&lt;h3&gt;The Sun! It Burns!&lt;/h3&gt;Deros are fixated with curing their allergy to sunlight. To understand how the surface dwellers can withstand the light of the sun, deros conduct late-night raids on surface cities, abducting victims and performing terrible experiments on them. Those who survive are often returned with much of their memory erased and their bodies bearing mysterious scars. When these repressed memories surface, they lead to wild, hazy recollections of being abducted.</Description>

        <Name>Devil</Name>
        <Description>Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.&lt;h3&gt;Archdevils&lt;/h3&gt;At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.&lt;h3&gt;Diabolic Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.&lt;h3&gt;Diabolic Locations&lt;/h3&gt;The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.&lt;h3&gt;Fiendish Relations&lt;/h3&gt;Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.&lt;h3&gt;Hellfire&lt;/h3&gt;Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.&lt;h3&gt;Hellmouths&lt;/h3&gt;While travel to and from Hell is possible with &lt;i&gt;plane shift&lt;/i&gt;, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.&lt;h3&gt;Other Devils&lt;/h3&gt;The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.&lt;h3&gt;Queens of the Night&lt;/h3&gt;The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.&lt;h3&gt;The Hierarchy of Hell&lt;/h3&gt;Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.</Description>

        <Name>Dhampir</Name>
        <Description>As the mortal offspring of a vampire and a living parent, dhampirs occupy an unusual place among the living. Their vampiric parentage lends them elongated incisors, an unearthly beauty and physical grace, a ghostly pallor, and a piercing gaze. Perhaps their most distinctive feature, however, is their connection to negative energy, which heals them, leaving them as vulnerable to positive energy as any undead creature. Though they don’t suffer the full range of a vampire’s vulnerabilities, they do share certain characteristics with their vampire parent, leading to several distinct dhampir heritages across Golarion. By far the most common dhampirs are svetocher, the children of the more common moroi vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Many dhampirs lived their childhoods as orphans, often because their mortal parents believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them, or perished as a result of a difficult childbirth. Often outcast, some dhampirs leverage their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them, while others struggle to form relationships. Frequent mistrust of a dhampir’s parentage present further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into mortal society. Those who seek out their vampiric parent instead often find themselves considered inferior, rejected as they were with regular mortals but for different reasons. But in regions like Nidal, Geb, and Ustalav, where vampires themselves carry some degree of respect, dhampirs can sometimes find their heritage empowering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dhampirs fill countless roles within many communities. Some prefer to blend in as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir’s mortal parent, but a rare few are born as dhampirs themselves). Those who learn to make the most of their inherited charm can achieve a high societal status, whether leveraging traditional avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir’s abilities. With a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive influence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. Further, their ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts.&lt;h3&gt;Dhampir Locations&lt;/h3&gt;Most dhampirs make their homes in urban areas, though some more reclusive individuals claim ruins or dungeons as their domains.</Description>

        <Description>Remnants from the world’s primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in isolated and remote wildernesses or far underground within magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild.&lt;h3&gt;Dinosaur Abilities&lt;/h3&gt;While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.&lt;h3&gt;Dinosaur Guardians&lt;/h3&gt;As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.&lt;h3&gt;Dinosaur Resources&lt;/h3&gt;As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.&lt;h3&gt;Dinosaurs in Fantasy&lt;/h3&gt;At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.&lt;h3&gt;Hollow Worlds&lt;/h3&gt;Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.&lt;h3&gt;Magical Dinosaurs&lt;/h3&gt;In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.&lt;h3&gt;Other Dinosaurs&lt;/h3&gt;A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!&lt;h3&gt;Primeval Lands&lt;/h3&gt;Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.</Description>

        <Name>Dog</Name>
        <Description>Dogs are trusted and loyal companions that serve as guardians, protectors, and hunting companions. Their ability to detect prey or predators via scent and their predilection to accompany humanoids makes them ideal pets for most adventurers. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs in the world—from tiny lapdogs who shower their masters in affection to muscular dogs that stand nearly 4 feet high at the shoulder—and they can be found in nearly any place where people reside. Larger breeds might even be used as mounts for smaller adventurers, and some cultures use dogs as beasts of burden capable of pulling sleds loaded with supplies across the icy tundra. Regardless, many adventurers find value in having a dog.&lt;h3&gt;Rabies&lt;/h3&gt;While many societies adore dogs and value them for their loyalty as pets, no affliction other than rabies can reverse sentiments about these creatures quite so easily. While many animals can be afflicted with this debilitating illness, something about a loyal family pet growing feral and violent as a result of the disease makes it that much worse.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Rabies&lt;/b&gt; (disease); &lt;b&gt;Saving Throw&lt;/b&gt; DC 17 Fortitude; &lt;b&gt;Stage 1&lt;/b&gt; sickened 1 (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 2&lt;/b&gt; sickened 2 (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 3&lt;/b&gt; confusion (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 4&lt;/b&gt; dead </Description>

        <Name>Dragon, Black</Name>
        <Description>Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They're immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can't survive the dragon's acidic presence.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Change Shape&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid.

These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region.

        <Name>Dragon, Blue</Name>
        <Description>Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

        <Name>Dragon, Brass</Name>
        <Description>Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics. </Description>

        <Name>Dragon, Bronze</Name>
        <Description>Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

There, ancient dragons maintain city-states and nations. In a vast region known as the Drakelands, chromatic dragons have subjugated the humanoid inhabitants and frequently war among themselves. However, a few good dragons maintain holdings there. In the region knowns as the Skyfire Mandate, a different dynamic exists: good dragons who chose to work in harmony with the humanoid inhabitants have created a buffer against the tyrants of the Drakelands. There, creatures known as dragonkin work alongside humanoids to patrol the border, making up a group known as the Dragon Legion.&lt;h3&gt;Other Draconic Creatures&lt;/h3&gt;The creatures that appear in this section are considered true dragons, but a multitude of other draconic creatures populate Golarion and beyond.

        <Description>Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles.

        <Name>Dragon, Gold</Name>
        <Description>Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Change Shape&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid.

        <Name>Dragon, Green</Name>
        <Description>Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei. </Description>

        <Name>Dragon, Metallic</Name>
        <Description>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars. &lt;h2&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h2&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

There, ancient dragons maintain city-states and nations. In a vast region known as the Drakelands, chromatic dragons have subjugated the humanoid inhabitants and frequently war among themselves. However, a few good dragons maintain holdings there. In the region knowns as the Skyfire Mandate, a different dynamic exists: good dragons who chose to work in harmony with the humanoid inhabitants have created a buffer against the tyrants of the Drakelands. There, creatures known as dragonkin work alongside humanoids to patrol the border, making up a group known as the Dragon Legion.&lt;h3&gt;Other Draconic Creatures&lt;/h3&gt;The creatures that appear in this section are considered true dragons, but a multitude of other draconic creatures populate Golarion and beyond. Among these are the powerful and deadly linnorms, a wide range of drakes, whimsical faerie dragons and pseudodragons, the cruel and deceitful azis, and the sinister undead raveners.</Description>

        <Name>Dragon, Red</Name>
        <Description>he largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon's internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

        <Name>Dragon, Silver</Name>
        <Description>Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

        <Name>Dragon, White</Name>
        <Description>The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.&lt;h3&gt;Shape-Changing Dragons&lt;/h3&gt; Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

        <Name>Drake</Name>
        <Description>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct—drakes are primitive draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any) of the cunning. While they’re weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed. &lt;h2&gt;Drake Eggs&lt;/h2&gt; While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.&lt;h3&gt;Drake Ecology&lt;/h3&gt;Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.&lt;h3&gt;Drake Hunters&lt;/h3&gt;The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.&lt;h3&gt;Drake Locations&lt;/h3&gt;While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.&lt;h3&gt;Drake Resources&lt;/h3&gt;While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.&lt;h3&gt;Drake Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.&lt;h3&gt;Drakes and Dragons&lt;/h3&gt;Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.&lt;h3&gt;Other Drakes&lt;/h3&gt;The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!</Description>

        <Name>Drow</Name>
        <Description>The first drow were elves who fled into the depths of the world from a devastating cataclysm thousands of years ago. In their journey below, they fell to bickering and in-fighting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own. Whether it was the influence of a specific demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug, or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism, and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and their flesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron—but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn’t simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one’s superior—be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships—is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire. Today, the existence of drow is an understood truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.&lt;h3&gt;Becoming a Drow&lt;/h3&gt;Rarely, when a surface elf commits an act of cruelty heinous enough to draw the attention of a demon lord, transformation into a drow can happen spontaneously—but these transformations are rare enough to be legends in their own right. No known instance of a drow reverting to an elf has ever been recorded.&lt;h3&gt;Drow Exiles&lt;/h3&gt;While drow society is evil, not all drow are bound to these norms. Those who seek something better in life are invariably exiles and often flee to the surface to escape their sinister kin. These drow often live as hermits, or they seek out societies where others have yet to hear the legends regarding their kind.</Description>

        <Name>Duergar</Name>
        <Description>Deep beneath the surface, duergars stubbornly claim the ancestral subterranean homelands of the dwarves as their own, having refused to venture to the surface along with their modern dwarven cousins. An exiled dwarven deity named Droskar offered duergars salvation from the horrors of the Darklands, and in exchange duergars endlessly toil in his honor within their subterranean empire. Notorious slavers, duergars regularly raid other Darklands settlements as well as surface communities in constant search of living beings to task with endless amounts of work in their harsh and exhausting settlements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as “ashen” by those surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it’s common to see duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all walks of life.&lt;h3&gt;Duergar Communities&lt;/h3&gt;Duergar communities are found deep underground in the ruins of abandoned dwarven cities. Generations of duergar occupation have resulted in the loss of dwarven history as the ashen honor their taskmaster deity by reworking traditional dwarven art into topics that elevate the exiled god. That duergars themselves seem incapable of achieving the heights of artistry mastered by their dwarven ancestors is both a source of frustration and shame that only fosters greater resentment of those who dwell on the surface.&lt;h3&gt;Occult Traditions&lt;/h3&gt;Unlike classical dwarven practitioners of magic, duergars have embraced the practice of occultism. All duergars have at least a few innate occult spells, primary among them being the ability to magically increase their size. This power not only aids them in intimidating and bullying their slaves, but also serves as a potent combat option against their many enemies.</Description>

While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.&lt;h3&gt;Mephit Names&lt;/h3&gt;Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow.

        <Description>Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping. Though the fleshwarping process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.&lt;h3&gt;Failed Fleshwarps&lt;/h3&gt;Not every fleshwarp emerges from its vat capable of survival. Many perish within minutes, as organs fundamental for life simply fail or collapse in on themselves. Fleshwarpers can usually recycle failed fleshwarps back into the mix quickly enough, but now and then, remnants known as fleshdregs are stable enough to live pain-wracked lives of their own. These foul creatures often infest fleshwarper holdings, like rats or other vermin do in less awful locations.&lt;h3&gt;Other Fleshwarps&lt;/h3&gt;Grothluts may be the weakest example of a fleshwarp, and driders the most successful, but others exist as well. Ghonhatines are lumbering fleshwarps formed from xulgaths, while the tentacled irnakurses are formed from surface-dwelling elves.

        <Description>Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not fixed; city-dwelling gargoyles who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash.</Description>

        <Description>A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are fire made flesh; marids are beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind. &lt;h2&gt;Genie Nobles&lt;/h2&gt; Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever.</Description>

        <Description>When some mortals die through tragic circumstances or without closure, they can linger on in the world. These anguished souls haunt a locale significant to them in life, constantly trying to right their perceived wrong or wrongdoings. &lt;h3&gt;Ghost Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; A ghost gains the incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become evil. If the base creature has any abilities or traits that come from it being a living, corporeal creature, it loses them. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkvision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Site Bound&lt;/b&gt; A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Negative Healing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/b&gt; (divine, necromancy) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Immunities&lt;/b&gt; death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Resistances&lt;/b&gt; all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance to non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fly Speed&lt;/b&gt; equal to its Speed&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ghostly Hand&lt;/b&gt; All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals negative damage. It typically has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. &lt;h3&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special&lt;/b&gt; Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes to fit the theme. For DCs, use 2 + the DC of the ghost's level.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Corrupting Gaze&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 negative damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also stupefied 1 for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Draining Touch&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Frightful Moan&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Inhabit Object&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Malevolent Possession&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same e  ect as the possession spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Telekinetic Assault&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] (divine, evocation) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reflex save.&lt;h3&gt;Building Ghosts&lt;/h3&gt;Note that the ghost mage is built from the ground up, rather than by applying the ghost rules to a once-living creature, so its numbers don’t exactly match the values listed above. This is usually the better way to go if you have the time, as it allows you to hand-craft a ghost for the situation.&lt;h3&gt;Custom Ghosts&lt;/h3&gt;Ghosts work best in adventures when used sparingly. As they are remnants of a past life and retain their intelligence, ghosts can convey long-lost information or serve as a way to inform the PCs of crucial story elements. In this way, a ghost in an adventure can provide a clue or even a complete history of a site or event. Unlike most other undead, ghosts can retain the alignment they had in life, but regardless they should remain tragic and frightening figures in play.</Description>

        <Name>Ghoul</Name>
        <Description>Few creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards and ruined crypts than the flesh-eating undead known as ghouls. &lt;h3&gt;Ghoul Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Darkvision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Negative Healing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Immunities&lt;/b&gt; death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Claws&lt;/b&gt; If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jaws&lt;/b&gt; If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Consume Flesh&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (manipulate) &lt;b&gt;Requirements&lt;/b&gt; The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ghoul Fever&lt;/b&gt; (disease) &lt;b&gt;Saving Throw&lt;/b&gt; Fortitude; &lt;b&gt;Stage&lt;/b&gt; 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage&lt;/b&gt; 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 3&lt;/b&gt; as stage 2 (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 4&lt;/b&gt; 2d6 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 5&lt;/b&gt; as stage 4 (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 6&lt;/b&gt; dead, and rises as a ghoul the next midnight.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paralysis&lt;/b&gt; (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Swift Leap&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. &lt;h3&gt;Ghast Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; A ghast has all the abilities above, plus following additions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stench&lt;/b&gt; (aura, olfactory) 10 feet A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save (use a DC based on the monster's level; Core Rulebook 503) or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Claws and Jaws&lt;/b&gt; As ghoul, but apply ghast fever instead of ghoul fever.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Consume Flesh&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] As ghoul, but it regains 1d6 additional Hit Points.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ghast Fever&lt;/b&gt; (disease) &lt;b&gt;Saving Throw&lt;/b&gt; Fortitude; &lt;b&gt;Stage 1&lt;/b&gt; carrier with no ill effect (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 2&lt;/b&gt; 3d8 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 3&lt;/b&gt; as stage 2 (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 4&lt;/b&gt; 3d8 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 5&lt;/b&gt; as stage 4 (1 day); &lt;b&gt;Stage 6&lt;/b&gt; dead, and rises as a ghast the next midnight&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paralysis&lt;/b&gt; (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) As ghoul, but elves are not immune. &lt;h3&gt;Ghoulish Society&lt;/h3&gt;Ghouls are quite intelligent and, more so than almost any other undead, prone to forming societies and cultures (if vile and repugnant ones centered around flesh eating and acts of depravity) in tangled warrens below boneyards, or even entire cities hidden away in the depths of the Darklands.&lt;h3&gt;The First Ghouls&lt;/h3&gt;Legend holds that the first humanoid (an elf, as it so happened) to feed upon the flesh of his brother rose as a ghoul after death, in time embracing his new life and ascending to great power as a demon lord of ghouls, graves, and secrets kept by the dead. That ghouls of humanoids warp and twist to take vaguely elven features, and that elves themselves are immune to ghoul paralysis, are unusual side effects of this ancient source, yet today, ghouls are as likely to worship other vile gods—or simply eschew faith entirely—as they are to honor the first of their kind.</Description>

        <Name>Giant</Name>
        <Description>Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.&lt;h3&gt;Giant Bags&lt;/h3&gt;Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.&lt;h3&gt;Giant Locations&lt;/h3&gt;As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.&lt;h3&gt;Giant Pets&lt;/h3&gt;As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.&lt;h3&gt;Other Giants&lt;/h3&gt;Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.&lt;h3&gt;Oversized Themes&lt;/h3&gt;Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.</Description>

        <Name>Gnoll</Name>
        <Description>Gnolls are short, hyena-headed humanoids who dwell in warm grasslands, savannas, and arid hills. Given their appearance, their affinity for hyenas should not be surprising; gnolls share their homes, food, and even many of their own behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, gnolls have a notorious reputation—they are known as bloodthirsty gluttons and slavers who worship demons or other reprehensible powers. Though these rumors are often true, the behavior of gnoll clans varies widely. Some groups are composed of capable hunters who rarely clash with other humanoids unless there is a conflict over territory. Others hew closer to the unsavory stories, preferring to raid settlements and enslave innocents, snatching the fruits of others’ hard labor by strength of arms and forcing their victims to perform the hard, demeaning labor necessary to maintain the brutal clan.&lt;br&gt; Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals. They willingly eat nearly any other creature, including dead gnolls, which can evoke strong reactions from people and cultures with a strong taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the dead. To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the   esh of a dead gnoll, which they consider an insult to that gnoll’s memory and sacrifice and an implication that the gnoll’s flesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the dead and intimidate would-be invaders.&lt;br&gt; Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and clans. Though gnolls tend to be disorganized when it comes to practical matters or negotiations, they are extremely efficient at working together to hunt down prey or overwhelm a group of foes. Much like hyenas, they prefer to hunt in packs, and are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating individual targets from larger groups.&lt;h3&gt;Gnoll Clans&lt;/h3&gt;The most commonly encountered gnoll clans are slavers, who travel far and wide to acquire chattel and auction off their living goods. Although not all clans engage in slavery, most are still violent toward other creatures in general. Some clans hunt people for food, others capture innocents to sacrifice to evil deities, and still others simply wish to wet their blades with blood.&lt;h3&gt;Gnoll Lairs&lt;/h3&gt;Gnolls dwell primarily on dry savannas and windswept plains. Thanks to their sturdy constitutions and strong survival instincts, they have few qualms about setting up holdings out in the open. Many gnolls establish their encampments—typically made up of hide lean-tos and tents—atop sloping hills to better survey the region for potential prey. Gnolls rarely dwell in caverns or similar enclosures, knowing that it is all too easy to get cornered when there is only one exit.</Description>

        <Name>Goblin</Name>
        <Description>These small humanoids have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears. While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding members of humanoid communities, most are impetuous and vicious creatures who delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock, stealing infants, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call “longshanks.”&lt;br&gt; Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with fire; goblins who master magic or fire earn great respect from their kin. Most other humanoids find it difficult to understand goblins’ outlook: they hate canines but eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger creatures but are terrified of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.&lt;h3&gt;Goblin Locations&lt;/h3&gt;Goblins construct warrens in forests and coastal regions, usually near the settlements of other humanoids for ease of scavenging and raiding.&lt;h3&gt;Goblin Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Although goblin warrens are generally filthy dumps, they sometimes contain actual treasures stolen from longshanks or other goblin tribes. Typical treasures include small pieces of jewelry, shiny items such as hand mirrors, and gold teeth. As they rarely trust each other, many goblins keep their most cherished baubles on their persons; these, might include useful weapons or minor magic items.&lt;h3&gt;The Goblin Song&lt;/h3&gt;The following ditty is perhaps the most infamous of goblin songs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Goblins chew and goblins bite,&lt;br&gt; Goblins cut and goblins fight.&lt;br&gt; Stab the dog and cut the horse,&lt;br&gt; Goblins eat and take by force!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Goblins race and goblins jump.&lt;br&gt; Goblins slash and goblins bump.&lt;br&gt; Burn the skin and mash the head,&lt;br&gt; Goblins here and you be dead!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Chase the baby, catch the pup.&lt;br&gt; Bonk the head to shut it up.&lt;br&gt; Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed,&lt;br&gt; We be goblins!

        <Name>Golem</Name>
        <Description>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator’s commands— often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator’s death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem’s unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.&lt;br&gt; Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.&lt;br&gt; Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars. &lt;h2&gt;Golem Antimagic&lt;/h2&gt; A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Harmed By&lt;/b&gt; Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Healed By&lt;/b&gt; Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Slowed By&lt;/b&gt; Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vulnerable To&lt;/b&gt; Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.</Description>

        <Name>Gremlin</Name>
        <Description>Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness. All gremlins delight in ruining or breaking things, whether it’s something physical like a device or vehicle or something intangible such as an alliance or relationship. A gremlin’s greatest joy is watching the collapse of complex creations, preferably after the lightest and slightest, carefully targeted push from the gremlin. Gremlins tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitflits, whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call “mites.”&lt;h3&gt;Gremlin "Treasure"&lt;/h3&gt;All gremlins are hoarders, and their nests are cluttered with objects both valuable and worthless. Sorting through a gremlin nest can reveal unexpected treasures like pieces of jewelry or minor magic items, but care must also be taken to avoid being cut on rusty shards of metal, picking up cursed items, or disturbing a hidden nest of venomous vermin.&lt;h3&gt;Gremlin Bells&lt;/h3&gt;Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner.&lt;h3&gt;Gremlin Faith&lt;/h3&gt;Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation.&lt;h3&gt;Gremlin Minions&lt;/h3&gt;Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies.</Description>

        <Description>Malevolent crones who lurk at the edges of civilization, hags use their deceptive, magical abilities to prey upon humanoids, manipulating and corrupting them. Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selfishness. Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items known as hag eyes, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own offspring—these children are changelings who have the potential to become hags themselves.&lt;h3&gt;Hag Covens&lt;/h3&gt;Hags are dangerous enough on their own, but when they gather in threes to form covens, they grow much more powerful.&lt;h3&gt;Haters of Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;Hags loathe all humanoid races, but not equally—the brunt of their wrath is leveled against humans. Hags prey on human society the most, adding human flesh to their cauldron and snatching newborn children before replacing the babes with their own progeny as changelings.&lt;h3&gt;Other Hags&lt;/h3&gt;The four types of hags presented here are but the most notorious of their kind. Others—such as the blood hag, moon hag, storm hag, and winter hag—plague society in other regions of the world.&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Hags&lt;/h3&gt;Some believe that hags possess no true form or body of their own, but instead manifest from society’s fear of aging.

        <Name>Hobgoblin</Name>
        <Description>Hobgoblins may appear to outsiders to be the most civilized of goblinkind, but their civilization is hardly one of kindness and equality—instead, they revel in all that is militaristic, tyrannical, cruel, and destructive. Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they’re fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes is an individual hobgoblin’s best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don’t usually engage in trade with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.&lt;h3&gt;Hobgoblins and Magic&lt;/h3&gt;Hobgoblins generally distrust magic, especially arcane magic, which they derisively call “elf magic.” In the absence of magic, they wholeheartedly embrace alchemy, combining it with their natural aptitude for engineering to great destructive effect. They grudgingly accept divine magic, due to a grudging respect for the power of healing magic in times of war.&lt;h3&gt;Living with Hobgoblins&lt;/h3&gt;With few exceptions, the only non-goblinoids in a hobgoblin settlement or army are slaves (or at least regarded as such). Hobgoblins occasionally make use of bugbears as assassins or spies, and most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins who eke out a meager existence on the fringes of hobgoblin society.</Description>

        <Description>Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halflings, often utilize ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are domesticated, though large herds of these powerful animals can be found in the wild.&lt;h3&gt;Goblins and Horses&lt;/h3&gt;Goblins have many superstitions and quirks, but few of them are stronger than their fear and hatred of horses. This isn’t a one-sided affair. Horses also fear and hate goblins, and some have been known to go out of their way to harm a goblin. A goblin trying to mount a horse is nearly always subject to a torrent of violent bucking, as the horse does everything in its power to fling the goblin to the ground and within reach of its hooves.</Description>

        <Name>Hyena</Name>
        <Description>Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like cries, and they aren’t above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.&lt;h3&gt;Hyena Legends&lt;/h3&gt;The hyena’s intense cunning, combined with its unnerving laughter, has caused hyenas to become associated with all manner of evil—hyenas are claimed to rob graves, steal children, and wield sinister supernatural powers. Though normal hyenas are no more malicious than any other natural predator, their unearned reputation often causes witches, warlords, and ill-natured creatures to seek out hyenas as pets or guard animals. The fact that gnolls in particular have a special preference for hyenas, considering the animals to be close relatives, does little to improve the animal’s already-poor reputation.</Description>

        <Name>Kobold</Name>
        <Description>Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids who carry physical similarities to true dragons. They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds’ innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no matter how brutal they might be to their kobold minions.&lt;h3&gt;"We are Dragons!"&lt;/h3&gt;Kobolds consider themselves scions of dragonkind, and they are extremely proud of this purported heritage, no matter how laughable other creatures might consider these claims. Despite such skepticism, kobolds share more than a superficial resemblance to true dragons, with scale colorations closely matching the colors seen among chromatic dragonkind. Some kobolds develop a strong propensity toward powerful draconic magic and manifest these chromatic traits with more intensity. These so-called dragon mages are highly respected by other kobolds, and often rise to leadership positions within the tribe.&lt;h3&gt;Diabolic Kobolds&lt;/h3&gt;Certain kobold tribes eschew any concept of draconic lineage entirely and instead place their faith in the archdevils of Hell. These diabolist kobolds view those of their kind who simper at the feet of dragons as pathetic wretches. That they perform the same fearful worship to their chosen devil does not strike these infernally minded kobolds as an irony at all.</Description>

Sinister magic comes naturally to a lamia, and they prefer the use of illusions and enchantments to deceive prey for later consumption, or simply to torture.&lt;h3&gt;Lamia Location&lt;/h3&gt;Lamias dwell on the edge of civilization in crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and the fallen temples of forgotten gods.&lt;h3&gt;Lamia Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Lamias salvage gold, jewels, and magic items from the abandoned temples and ruined cities where they make their lairs.

        <Name>Leshy</Name>
        <Description>Leshys are intelligent plant creatures that guard areas of primeval wilderness or earthly power. Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled practitioner of primal magic—typically a druid—combines a nature spirit with a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given life in an area of great natural significance, such as an arboreal’s grove, a druidic circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder.&lt;h3&gt;Associated Monsters&lt;/h3&gt;Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures.&lt;h3&gt;Dead Leshy&lt;/h3&gt;When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life.&lt;h3&gt;Leshy Communities&lt;/h3&gt;Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future.&lt;h3&gt;Leshy Heroes&lt;/h3&gt;Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.</Description>

        <Name>Lich</Name>
        <Description>To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich’s new power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich’s servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich’s lair is a good indicator of the undead’s current mental state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation. &lt;h3&gt;Lich Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; A lich gains the undead trait and becomes evil. Liches lose all abilities that come from being a living creature.&lt;br&gt; A lich gains the following abilities.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Darkvision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Saving Throws&lt;/b&gt; +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Negative Healing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/b&gt; (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately transfers to its phylactery. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its phylactery is found and destroyed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Immunities&lt;/b&gt; death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Resistances&lt;/b&gt; cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning)&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Frightful Presence&lt;/b&gt; (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hand of the Lich&lt;/b&gt; All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage for every 3 levels and inflicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the finesse trait.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Drain Phylactery&lt;/b&gt; [[Free Action]] &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The lich taps into its phylactery's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's phylactery doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paralyzing Touch&lt;/b&gt; (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 4. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive. &lt;h3&gt;Alternate Lich Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; Although the abilities above are standard for a lich, you can create a more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful presence, hand of the lich, Drain Phylactery, or paralyzing touch.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Blasphemous Utterances&lt;/b&gt; (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10 flat check. Failing this check wastes the action.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cold Beyond Cold&lt;/b&gt; The lich's hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Dark Deliverance&lt;/b&gt; The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Siphon Life&lt;/b&gt; [[Reaction]] &lt;b&gt;Trigger&lt;/b&gt; The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The lich regains Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Void Shroud&lt;/b&gt; (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger. Living creatures in the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4.&lt;h3&gt;Associated Monsters&lt;/h3&gt;Undead minions are very common companions for a lich or demilich. Liches prefer mindless undead, that do what they’re told and don’t interrupt the lich’s studies with useless conversation. Liches with a knack for crafting are also fond of surrounding themselves with construct servitors and guardians, such as golems.</Description>

        <Name>Linnorm</Name>
        <Description>Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.&lt;h3&gt;Death Curses&lt;/h3&gt;The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.&lt;h3&gt;First World Connections&lt;/h3&gt;Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.&lt;h3&gt;Linnorm Kings&lt;/h3&gt;In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.&lt;h3&gt;Linnorm Legends&lt;/h3&gt;Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.&lt;h3&gt;Linnorm Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.&lt;h3&gt;Newborn Linnorms&lt;/h3&gt;Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.&lt;h3&gt;Other Linnorms&lt;/h3&gt;Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.&lt;h3&gt;Rarer Linnorms&lt;/h3&gt;While the linnorms presented here and in the first &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!</Description>

The three species presented here represent the most common and well-known of the larger species.&lt;h3&gt;Lizard Locations&lt;/h3&gt;Giant lizards can be found in all temperate or tropical climates, often in relatively close proximity to smaller villages or rural regions where they can be a dangerous threat to livestock or travelers. The two lizards presented here tend to dwell in warmer regions— jungles for giant chameleons, and savannas for megalanias.&lt;h3&gt;Lizards and Lizardfolk&lt;/h3&gt;Giant lizards are often used as mounts or guardians or kept as pets, but never so often or as traditionally as they are by lizardfolk. The kinship these people share with giant lizards is unmistakable, valuing their companionship to an extent that equals or even exceeds that which other societies have for popular animal companions like dogs and horses.&lt;h3&gt;Other Giant Lizards&lt;/h3&gt;The three species of giant lizard presented here are but the most common of their kind encountered in the wilds. Stories of much larger lizards persist, including the immense, 20-foot-long monster known as a megalania, a truly enormous version of the giant monitor lizard capable of swallowing creatures whole. Less dangerous is the giant chameleon, although its ability to blend into its environs makes it a much more insidious and stealthy threat than the lumbering, mighty megalania.</Description>

        <Name>Lizardfolk</Name>
        <Description>When human scholars speak of ancient civilizations, they usually turn their focus to themselves, researching and lecturing on the first human empires. When they drift to others, they invariably look to cultures that had conflicts or alliances with ancient humanity. That the culture of the people called lizardfolk often gets ignored or forgotten even by well-meaning researchers is thus no surprise, but to the lizardfolk themselves it is no matter. They know their history and value its integrity and privacy—if younger ancestries like humanity aren’t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back to before the first human knocked two rocks together to make their first campfire, that’s fine with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The word “lizardfolk” is an excellent example of humanity’s narrow-sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is “iruxi,” but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and good-naturedly accepted the name “lizardfolk” as a variant, and they generally resist urges to call humans and other mammalians similarly derivative names in return. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and riverlands, for they are talented swimmers, and fish and aquatic plants make up a large part of their preferred diets.&lt;h3&gt;Lizardfolk Relations&lt;/h3&gt;Though most are neutral in alignment, the typical iruxi’s pride in their traditions, suspicion of others, and need to protect their kin can make them seem standoffish or even aggressive when encountered. However, most are eager to learn from visitors, trade stories and equipment, and forge alliances.&lt;h3&gt;Lizardfolk Society&lt;/h3&gt;Iruxis are, as a general rule, quite religious. Those who venerate deities typically look to Gozreh, but some of them find the teachings of Desna to be compelling. Most iruxis, though, instead follow druidic traditions, ancestor worship, and astrological philosophies in particular.</Description>

        <Name>Nymph</Name>
        <Description>Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water. &lt;h2&gt;Nymph Queens&lt;/h2&gt; Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” &lt;h2&gt;Nymph Queen Abilities&lt;/h2&gt; A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Change Shape&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Focus Beauty&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Inspiration&lt;/b&gt; [[Three Actions]] (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.&lt;br&gt; If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nymph’s Beauty&lt;/b&gt; (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen’s entry.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tied to the Land&lt;/b&gt; A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.&lt;h3&gt;Inspirations for Art&lt;/h3&gt;Nymphs are living manifestations of beauty and grace, and as such they are often the subjects of art—sculpture and paintings in particular. Promising a nymph to immortalize them in a work of art can be an excellent way to secure that nymph’s favor, but one should take care to ensure that the nymph admires and is proud of the artistic effort’s final result, lest the nymph be insulted and lash out with her powerful magic.&lt;h3&gt;Nymph Locations&lt;/h3&gt;Nymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads. Areas where nymphs dwell always look more pristine, breathtaking, and scenic than they would otherwise.&lt;h3&gt;Nymph Treasures&lt;/h3&gt;Nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse.&lt;h3&gt;Other Nymphs&lt;/h3&gt;Naiads and dryads are the most well-known nymphs, but others exist as well. Hesperides, for example, are wards of the sunset and golden light and can be encountered dwelling on coastal cliffsides or remote islands. Lampads, on the other hand, are dark, moody nymphs found in wondrous, crystal-lined caverns deep underground.</Description>

        <Name>Ogre</Name>
        <Description>Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids— the smaller and more beautiful, the better—ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre’s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres’ playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre’s limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the “boss”—usually the family’s patriarch or matriarch—while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss’s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.&lt;h3&gt;Ogre Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Ogre warrens are hideous abattoirs strewn with severed limbs, offal, and dubious stews. Ogres sometimes keep shiny baubles, like jewelry, and they appreciate intimidating weapons and armor, especially those that are large enough for them to use.</Description>

        <Name>Ooze</Name>
        <Description>Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests. While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.&lt;h3&gt;Amoebas Large and Small&lt;/h3&gt;Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.&lt;h3&gt;Oozing Acid&lt;/h3&gt;Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.&lt;h3&gt;Other Oozes&lt;/h3&gt;Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.</Description>

        <Name>Orc</Name>
        <Description>Orcs are violent, monstrous humanoids that live by the rule that might makes right. They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements, outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs’ war beasts as they are to be taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to capture by orcs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically custom-made for violence with their rough flesh, sturdy bone, and iron-hard muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible. They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing, and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds of blood are especially strong among orcs, and lineage is important. The strongest orc bands are typically made up of brothers and sisters in more than arms; orcs fight harder when they are protecting their own kinsfolk, and orc warriors will fight tirelessly to avenge fallen family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged sword. Orcs whose families have been killed find themselves at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to back them up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This cultural divergence causes substantial infighting among orc bands, in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among others. Navigating a specific band’s culture can often mean the difference between life and death to those who deal with orcs off the field of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely deal with outsiders, they recognize the benefits of trade and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans.&lt;h3&gt;Gods of War&lt;/h3&gt;Orcs worship violent deities that support their murderous instincts, chiefly Rovagug, but also Lamashtu and Gorum and sometimes demon lords like Nurgal and Shax.&lt;h3&gt;Megafauna Mounts&lt;/h3&gt;Orcs are known for riding strange and fearsome beasts, particularly megafauna like dire wolves and smilodons. Given the opportunity, orcs also enlist drakes, manticores, and anything else big and frightening enough to suit their needs.</Description>

And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.&lt;h3&gt;Extraplanar Humanoids&lt;/h3&gt;An important distinction exists between planar scions and extraplanar humanoids, such as fetchlings. Fetchlings and other extraplanar humanoids represent true ancestral groups with their own physical and cultural identities and traditions. Planar scions are members of diverse ancestries who share a similar inheritance from extraplanar beings and, with exception of marids, typically integrate into other humanoid societies instead of building their own.&lt;h3&gt;Other Planar Scions&lt;/h3&gt;As many types of planar scions exist as planes of existence, and even then there are significant differences between scions depending on the exact nature of their extraplanar forebears. Angelic scions are known as aasimars, fiendish scions are called tieflings, and monitor scions are urobians.&lt;h3&gt;Other Planar Scions&lt;/h3&gt;Two other planar scions are the entropy-infused ganzi and their polar opposites, the orderly aphorites, scions of chaos and law respectively.&lt;h3&gt;Planar Origins&lt;/h3&gt;Most planar scions are the distant descendants of some immortal progenitor far back in the family’s bloodline. Others, however, may be the result of powerful planar energies, magical curses, or even the intervention of a deity or demigod.</Description>

        <Name>Protean</Name>
        <Description>Guardians of disorder and natives of the primal plane of chaos known as the Maelstrom, proteans consider it their calling to spread bedlam and hasten entropic ends. The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults on the Material Plane tend to be obscure and secretive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy? &lt;h2&gt;Warpwaves&lt;/h2&gt; Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure) &lt;h3&gt;Ancient Immortals&lt;/h3&gt;Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.&lt;h3&gt;Born from Chaos&lt;/h3&gt;The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.&lt;h3&gt;Defending Chaos&lt;/h3&gt;Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.&lt;h3&gt;Other Proteans&lt;/h3&gt;Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.&lt;h3&gt;Protean Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.&lt;h3&gt;Protean Names&lt;/h3&gt;Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”</Description>

        <Name>Psychopomp</Name>
        <Description>Psychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead native to the Boneyard, the vast plane of graves where mortal souls are judged and sent on to their eternal rewards or damnations. Psychopomps ensure that the dead come to terms with their transition from mortality and are properly sorted into the appropriate afterlife. They also protect souls from being preyed upon by supernatural predators. Nearly all psychopomps wear masks, especially when they’re likely to be interacting with mortals, although the types of masks they wear are as varied as the psychopomps themselves. The courts of the Boneyard preside in Requian, a somber yet melodic language spoken slowly with various tonal shifts.&lt;h3&gt;Other Pyschopomps&lt;/h3&gt;Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.&lt;h3&gt;Psychopomp Courts&lt;/h3&gt;Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.&lt;h3&gt;Psychopomp Foes&lt;/h3&gt;Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.&lt;h3&gt;Psychopomp Traitors&lt;/h3&gt;Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.&lt;h3&gt;Psychopomps Divinities&lt;/h3&gt;The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.</Description>

Despite common misconceptions that they are dirty or diseased, ysoki, as they call themselves, keep impeccably clean. Ratfolk are also sometimes mistaken for wererats and initially treated with fear until they can correct the mistaken identiflcation—if they get the chance to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In general, ratfolk have a keen understanding of pathological and alchemical sciences, which they employ in trade and self-defense. They make accomplished alchemists and tinkerers, and they often protect their lairs with traps, bombs, and other creations. Ratfolk merchants regularly dispatch large trade caravans that travel widely for a year or more before returning to their home community. During this time they make an effort to learn new things from the people they encounter and collect new, interesting materials and goods that they can bring back to their warrens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In their warrens, on the road, and in cities, ratfolk are extremely communal, thriving on proximity to and contact with one another even in relatively tight spaces. In addition, ratfolk are excellent at fighting in cramped spaces alongside their kin. Threatening one ratfolk or their allies is a sure  re way to rally the whole community.&lt;h3&gt;Ratfolk Locations&lt;/h3&gt;On Golarion, ysoki are most numerous in the Darklands below the continent of Tian Xia, where they rule a vast empire, but they can be found in the Inner Sea region as well—particularly in the badlands and hills of Numeria, where they eagerly scavenge and collect strange technological wonders and weapons.</Description>

When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sea devils are the first suspects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves “sahuagin” but have wholly embraced their enemies’ name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MembersSea Devil Baron (Creature 6), Sea Devil Brute (Creature 4), Sea Devil Scout (Creature 2)&lt;h3&gt;Sea Devil "Diplomacy"&lt;/h3&gt;Sea devils dwell in most of the world's oceans, and they view all others as enemies.

        <Name>Sinspawn</Name>
        <Description>Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively as runelords—each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn’t long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn’s veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.&lt;h2&gt;Sinspawn Sins&lt;/h2&gt; When a sinspawn is created, it becomes associated with one of the seven sins: envoy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn’s sin is determined by the &lt;i&gt;runewell&lt;/i&gt; that spawned it or by its creator’s preferred sin, and cannot be changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated with it additional benefits and abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn stat block, as detailed below.&lt;h3&gt;GLUTTONYSPAWN&lt;/h3&gt; A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese, but hardy and strong.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Melee&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] scythe +10 (deadly d10, trip), &lt;b&gt;Damage&lt;/b&gt; 1d10+4 slashing&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sinful Bite&lt;/b&gt; Creatures that critically fail their saves against a gluttonyspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1. &lt;h3&gt;GREEDSPAWN&lt;/h3&gt; A greedspawn has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive.

The skeleton is blind until then.&lt;h3&gt;Unlife without Flesh&lt;/h3&gt;The necromantic energies that infuse animated undead skeletons give them the ability to see without eyes and move without muscles.

Regardless, all snakes consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.&lt;h3&gt;Eating Habits&lt;/h3&gt;Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.&lt;h3&gt;Snake Resources&lt;/h3&gt;Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.&lt;h3&gt;Snakes in Mythology&lt;/h3&gt;Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.</Description>

        <Name>Spider</Name>
        <Description>Few everyday vermin inspire as much dread as the infamous spider.&lt;h3&gt;Associated Monsters&lt;/h3&gt;Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.&lt;h3&gt;Other Giant Spiders&lt;/h3&gt;A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.</Description>

        <Name>Sprite</Name>
        <Description>Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms “fey” or “fairy.” While their dispositions vary from the benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite.&lt;h3&gt;Sprite Pranks&lt;/h3&gt;Sprite pranks tend to be kind‑hearted in nature; they might use their abilities to embarrass a braggart or to trick them into a convoluted scheme to help someone notice an admirer who has been there for them all along. Their plans are often half-baked; sprites’ mercurial nature means they can easily become distracted by something new before following through on a previous plan.</Description>

        <Name>Troll</Name>
        <Description>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.&lt;h3&gt;Troll Augurs&lt;/h3&gt;Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal.&lt;h3&gt;Troll Blood&lt;/h3&gt;The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.</Description>

        <Name>Vampire</Name>
        <Description>Vampires are undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living.&lt;h3&gt;Basic Vampire Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Negative Healing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Immunities&lt;/b&gt; death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Coffin Restoration&lt;/b&gt; (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vampire Weaknesses&lt;/b&gt; All vampires possess the following weaknesses.&lt;b&gt;Compulsions&lt;/b&gt; Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below). &lt;b&gt;Revulsion&lt;/b&gt; A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). &lt;b&gt;Stake&lt;/b&gt; A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. &lt;b&gt;Sunlight&lt;/b&gt; If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.&lt;b&gt;Climb Speed&lt;/b&gt; Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Claws&lt;/b&gt; If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Drink Blood&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (divine, necromancy); &lt;b&gt;Requirement&lt;/b&gt; A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.&lt;br&gt; A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Grab&lt;/b&gt; The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab.&lt;h3&gt;True Vampire Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire spawn, or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resistances&lt;/b&gt; The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Create Spawn&lt;/b&gt; (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mist Escape&lt;/b&gt; [[Free Action]] &lt;b&gt;Trigger&lt;/b&gt; The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Change Shape&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines.&lt;br&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Bat&lt;/b&gt; The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Children of the Night&lt;/b&gt; (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Dominate&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Drink Blood&lt;/b&gt; As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Turn to Mist&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely. &lt;h3&gt;Building Vampires&lt;/h3&gt;Because vampires can inflict their nature upon any creature whose blood they drink, practically any living monster can become one of these undead horrors. When you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. In most cases, it’s more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire spawn, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vampire to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, Mist Escape, and Drink Blood work the same.&lt;h3&gt;Non-Evil Vampires&lt;/h3&gt;Non-evil vampires are rare and at odds with their basic nature. Such vampires typically give up a fraction of their power in exchange for some of their lost humanity.&lt;h3&gt;Vampire and Dhampir&lt;/h3&gt;The most common and traditional vampires, as presented here, are known also as the “moroi.” They are prevalent in Golarion in the mist-shrouded counties of Ustalav and found in small numbers in almost every nation of the Inner Sea. Other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang shi, and the psychic vetala—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. Dhampir can be born of any of these vampire races, though moroi-born dhampir known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the Inner Sea region.</Description>

The wasps represented here are of the common variety also known as yellowjackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire villages, and the dreaded extraplanar hellwasps, which build their nests within the corpses of their victims.&lt;h3&gt;Paralytic Poison&lt;/h3&gt;The poison of the giant wasp loses its potency soon after being harvested, but alchemists have learned of a way to preserve some of its properties by adding a number of harsh additives; this method makes it even deadlier.&lt;h3&gt;Sacred Stingers&lt;/h3&gt;Wasps are upheld as sacred among the priesthood of the elven deity Calistria, goddess of vengeance. Some priests of Calistria summon giant wasps or wasp swarms as servitors, while a few nurture giant wasps as pets, temple guardians, or companions. Followers of Calistria, both clergy and laypeople alike, seek to emulate the wasp’s penchant for leaving stung victims alive to suffer over a long period: a fitting model for revenge.</Description>

        <Name>Werecreature</Name>
        <Description>Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. These shapechanging creatures are the result of an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. Their ability to lurk unseen in the wilds as well as among people, combined with the contagiousness of their condition, makes werecreatures a perennial cause of panicked suspicion.&lt;h2&gt;Afflicted and True Werecreatures&lt;/h2&gt; Werecreatures come in two types: those afflicted with the curse and those born with it (“true werecreatures”).&lt;br&gt; One can be born a true werecreature to any werecreature parent. A true werecreature is always a werecreature and retains the same memories and most of the same statistics in all forms. A true werecreature also has full control over its shapechanging except during the full moon, when the transformation is irresistible. There is no known way to break the curse on a true werecreature.&lt;br&gt; Affected werewolves received their curse from the bite of another werecreature (which could’ve been an afflicted or true werecreature). An afflicted werecreature may be unaware of its curse because it retains no memories of its transformations, gets no benefit from being a werecreature when not transformed, and has no conscious control over its transformation. An afflicted werecreature’s curse can be removed like any other.&lt;h3&gt;Werecreature Abilities&lt;/h3&gt; All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature (such as abilities with a conflicting alignment trait).&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Senses&lt;/b&gt; The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Animal Empathy&lt;/b&gt; (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of the same general kind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Claws&lt;/b&gt; The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jaws&lt;/b&gt; The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Change Shape&lt;/b&gt; [[Single Action]] (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Curse of the Werecreature&lt;/b&gt; (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature's new level – 1. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Moon Frenzy&lt;/b&gt; (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours. &lt;h3&gt;Building Werecreatures&lt;/h3&gt;The curse of the werecreature comes in myriad forms and can affect any humanoid, allowing you to make a wide variety of werecreatures for your adventures. When you need to create a werecreature for your game, you can do so in one of two ways. You can simply build the werecreature from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the werebear, wererat, and werewolf presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under “Creating Werecreatures” to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a werecreature. In either case, specific werecreature abilities like Change Shape, curse of the werecreature, and moon frenzy work the same.&lt;h3&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/h3&gt;Many scholars refer to the curse of the werecreature as “lycanthropy,” but technically this is correct only when speaking of werewolves. Nevertheless, the word has gained traction in certain circles, and as a result it's not uncommon to hear the whispers of locals who fear lycanthropes even when a ravenous weretiger is the real threat. Naturally, the werecreatures themselves don't take this ignorance lightly, and tend to see being equated with a werewolf as a great insult. Unless, of course, the werecreature is a werewolf!&lt;h3&gt;Other Werecreatures&lt;/h3&gt;In theory, any animal could form the basis for a new type of werecreature, provided the animal in question is at least omnivorous—herbivorous werecreatures are all but unheard of. Werecreatures that rise from insects, arachnids, and similar invertebrate animals are particularly unsettling, though much rarer than werecreatures of vertebrate animals.&lt;h3&gt;Retaining Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;Werecreatures are notorious for their murderous rampages in the deep of the night—violence that is often at odds with the afflicted’s true nature. Even an honorable town guard or priest could be a murderous werewolf without realizing it, for the werecreature’s curse leaves the afflicted with no memory of their nocturnal murder sprees.&lt;h3&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/h3&gt;Wolfsbane is a poisonous plant that can cure the curse of the werecreature. It’s effective only if consumed before the creature transforms for the first time. If the creature survives wolfsbane’s effects without using magic to aid in surviving, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against the curse of the werecreature. On a success, the creature is cured.</Description>

        <Name>Wight</Name>
        <Description>Wights are undead humanoids that, much like wraiths, can drain the life from living creatures with but a touch. They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.</Description>

        <Description>Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill. Like most predatory animals, wolves prefer to attack the weakest or most vulnerable prey they can find.&lt;h3&gt;Wolf Packs&lt;/h3&gt;Wolf packs claim and defend large swaths of territory, which they regularly patrol in search of both prey and competitors. It takes a pack roughly 10 days to cover the entire breadth of its territory, which can stretch for miles in any direction but usually adheres to natural terrain. Wolves keep claim over their territories by marking trees with their scent and howling to keep other packs away. If these warnings prove insufficient to drive off potential competitors, the pack attacks the intruders directly</Description>

        <Name>Wraith</Name>
        <Description>Wraiths are malevolent undead who drain life and shun light. Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reflect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As they're formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They're among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.</Description>

        <Name>Xulgath</Name>
        <Description>Reptilian humanoids who live in the uppermost reaches of the Darklands, xulgaths (known as troglodytes to many surface-dwelling folk) often attack intruders in their territory on sight. They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.&lt;h3&gt;Other Xulgath Religions&lt;/h3&gt;Zevgavizeb is the most popular deity among xulgaths—particularly in the largest and most successful clutches—but other demon lords and deities are worshipped as well. Among Golarion's major gods, Pharasma, Rovagug, and even Erastil are known to answer the prayers of xulgath devotees.&lt;h3&gt;Xulgath Society&lt;/h3&gt;Xulgaths respect strength, and the leader of a community is usually the strongest of all of them. The leader’s dominance is rarely questioned until a potentially stronger xulgath believes it’s time for a change in rulership. The two xulgaths then face off in a fight to the death, with the victor claiming rule.&lt;h3&gt;Xulgath Treasure&lt;/h3&gt;Xulgaths are relatively primitive, using tools and weapons of stone and other materials scavenged from the surface. These can replicate most simple and a few martial melee weapons, as well as simple thrown ranged weapons. An advanced tribe of xulgaths might be able to craft low-level magical talismans, such as a potency crystal or a returning clasp.</Description>

        <Name>Zombie</Name>
        <Description>A zombie’s only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they’re destroyed. &lt;h2&gt;Zombie Abilities&lt;/h2&gt; You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Disgusting Pustules&lt;/b&gt; (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Feast&lt;/b&gt; [[Two Actions]] (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie’s level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Plague-Ridden&lt;/b&gt; (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie’s zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie’s type, rather than a plague zombie.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Rotting Aura&lt;/b&gt; (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Unkillable&lt;/b&gt; This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie’s level by 1 if you give it this ability.&lt;h3&gt;Creating Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;To create a zombie creature, start with a zombie of the appropriate size. Then add any Strikes, Speeds, or other abilities it would gain from its shape. To create a Gargantuan zombie, begin with the zombie hulk, apply the elite adjustments, change its size to Gargantuan, and increase its reach by 5 feet.&lt;h3&gt;Risen from the Grave&lt;/h3&gt;Zombies are often created using unwholesome necromantic rituals. Among the living dead, zombies are most often used as fodder, wearing down defenses and consuming resources before more powerful undead arrive to deal the killing blow. Zombies cannot speak or really even think for themselves, but they can be commanded by other allied undead and powerful necromancers.</Description>
